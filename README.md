# Computer-aided conflict detection between open source software licenses

This is a reproduction package of a thesis submitted by Victor van Herel in the Master's program Computer Science at the University of Antwerp.

## Requirements

- A Python 3.8+ environment
- Ollama installed and configured (https://ollama.com/)
- Dependencies installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- OSADL and SPDX datasets downloaded, via the `download_resources.sh` helper script.

## Scripts

- [Preliminary] generate_csv.py: Generates a CSV file from the OSADL dataset's compatibility matrix, allowing introspection.
- [Experiment 1] copyleft_clause.py: Runs inference for a given model configured at the top of the file.
- [Experiment 1] copyleft_analysis.py: Runs Majority-of-X analysis of inference results generated by copyleft_clause.py.
- [Experiment 1] copyleft_generate_html_summary.py: Generates an HTML summary of the inference results generated by copyleft_clause.py, which allows individual inaccuracy analysis.
- [Experiment 2] combinations_analysis.py: Runs the combination algorithm on the results provided by Experiment 1.
