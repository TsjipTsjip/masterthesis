**Explanation:**

This Academic Free License (v. 2.0) is a permissive license. It grants broad rights to use, modify, and distribute the Original Work and its derivatives. However, it does *not* include any copyleft provisions. Copyleft licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL), require that derivative works also be licensed under the same terms, ensuring that the freedoms associated with the original work are maintained throughout the derivative&#x27;s lifecycle. This license allows for commercial use, incorporation into proprietary software, and other scenarios that would be restricted by a copyleft license.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="No.

This Academic Free License (AFL) is a permissive license. It grants broad rights to use, modify, and distribute the Original Work and Derivative Works without requiring those derivative works to also be licensed under the AFL.

**Explanation:**

This Academic Free License (v. 2.0) does *not* contain a copyleft clause. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **Permissive License:** It’s a permissive license, meaning it grants broad rights to use, modify, and distribute the Original Work and its derivatives, provided certain attribution requirements are met.
*   **No Reciprocal Obligations:** The license doesn’t require derivative works to be licensed under the same terms. It only mandates attribution to the original author and adherence to certain restrictions (e.g., no trademark use without permission).
*   **Lack of &quot;Share Alike&quot; Provision:** A key characteristic of copyleft licenses is the &quot;share alike&quot; clause – the stipulation that any derivative work must also be licensed under the same terms. This is absent in this license.

Therefore, this license is considered a permissive license rather than a copyleft license.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Majority vote resulting from: False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False">False</abbr></td></tr><tr><td>AFL-2.1</td><td>No</td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This license, the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), contains a strong copyleft clause. Specifically, sections 15 (Disclaimer of Warranty) and 16 (Limitation of Liability) alongside the overall intent of the license, reinforce this copyleft provision. The AGPL requires that if you modify and/or distribute the software (particularly if it&#x27;s used over a network), you must make the source code available to users under the same AGPL terms. This ensures that any derivative works also remain freely available and that the freedoms granted by the license are maintained. The explicit requirement for providing source code upon network use is a core element of the AGPL’s copyleft strategy.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license, the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), contains a strong copyleft clause. Specifically, section 17 states: &quot;If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the program in return for a fee.” This strongly suggests a copyleft approach.

Furthermore, several other sections (13, 17) emphasize the requirement for providing source code to users interacting remotely and safeguarding the freedom to modify and redistribute. This all points to a copyleft license.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

The GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) is a copyleft license. Specifically, Section 17, &quot;Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16,&quot; explicitly states: “If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.” This clearly indicates a requirement for derivative works to maintain the same licensing terms, thus fulfilling the definition of a copyleft clause. Furthermore, sections pertaining to source code availability and remote network interaction reinforce the license’s goal of preserving freedom and preventing proprietary control over derivative works.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

The GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) is a copyleft license. Specifically, it includes several provisions that enforce a copyleft clause:

*   **Section 7:** Addresses the scenario where the Corresponding Source is not available for free copying. It mandates actions to either ensure availability or deprive the party of the patent license.
*   **Section 8:** This section outlines discriminatory patent licenses, which are closely tied to the copyleft requirements.
*   **Overall Structure:** The license’s fundamental goal is to ensure that any derivative works also remain freely available under the AGPL, preventing proprietary restrictions from being imposed. The detailed sections regarding source availability and patent licensing reinforce this core copyleft principle.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

The GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) is a copyleft license. Specifically, sections 15, 16, and 17, along with the overall structure of the license, demonstrate this. The key elements that establish a copyleft clause are:

*   **Requirement for Derivative Works:** The license explicitly states that if you modify and distribute a covered work, you must make the source code available under the same AGPL terms. This is the core of a copyleft clause.
*   **Warranty Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability:** Although these clauses are common in many software licenses, they are particularly significant in copyleft licenses as they limit the rights of users to sue for damages if the software is defective.
*   **Extension to Downstream Recipients:** When you convey a covered work and grant a patent license, the license automatically extends those rights to all recipients of the covered work.

The AGPL&#x27;s goal is to ensure that anyone who uses or distributes the software, including modifications, retains the freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute it. This is achieved through the requirements to share the source code and grant patent licenses.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license, the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), contains a strong copyleft clause. Specifically, Section 17 explicitly states: &quot;If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program...&quot; This clause is a fundamental aspect of copyleft licenses. Furthermore, sections 15 and 16, while limiting liability, are inextricably linked to the core copyleft principles. The license’s aim is to ensure that anyone who modifies or distributes the software (including via a network service) must also release their changes under the AGPL, preventing proprietary derivatives.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license, the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), is a strong copyleft license. Several key elements contribute to this determination:

*   **&quot;The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.&quot;** This indicates ongoing maintenance and potential updates, preserving the core copyleft principles.
*   **\u201cYou have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.\u201d** This extension of the license to combined works further reinforces the copyleft aspect.
*   **The entire focus of the license is to ensure that the freedoms associated with the original work are maintained in derivative works.** The explicit language about distribution under the same license reinforces this core principle.

The AGPL is designed to prevent software from being &quot;applied to&quot; without sharing the source code, ensuring that derivative works also remain free software.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license, the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), contains a strong copyleft clause. Here’s why:

*   **“You have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.”** This explicitly allows combining works, but crucially, the terms of the AGPL continue to apply to the part which is the covered work.
*   **“If you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge…”** This requirement to provide access to the source code upon remote interaction further reinforces the copyleft nature of the license.

The AGPL is designed to ensure that any derivative works remain freely available under the same terms, preventing the software from being incorporated into proprietary or closed-source products without releasing the source code. This is a core characteristic of a copyleft license.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license, the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), is a copyleft license. This is explicitly stated in several key sections:

*   **Section 17:** This section emphasizes that if the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability cannot be given local legal effect, reviewing courts should apply local law that most closely approximates an &quot;absolute waiver of all civil liability,&quot; highlighting the copyleft nature.
*   **Section 17:** Also addresses the &quot;Disclaimer of Warranty&quot; which is a standard part of copyleft licenses.
*   **Overall Purpose:** The AGPL is designed to ensure that any derivative works also remain free software and are distributed under the same terms, preventing proprietary control. The requirement to provide source code remotely and the strong copyleft clauses firmly establish this.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license, the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), *does* contain a strong copyleft clause. Several key elements demonstrate this:

*   **&quot;You have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.&quot;** - This allows linking, but crucially, it doesn&#x27;t grant permission to use the AGPL-licensed code without making the combined work available under the AGPL.
*   **“You have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.”** - This is explicitly stated within the license.
*   The entire design of the AGPL is built around ensuring that derivative works also carry the copyleft restrictions.

Therefore, if you modify or distribute a work incorporating code licensed under the AGPL, you *must* also offer the source code of your derivative work under the AGPL. This is the core characteristic of a copyleft license.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license, the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), is explicitly a copyleft license. Several key provisions demonstrate this:

*   **Section 7 (Patent License):** This section grants a patent license to anyone who uses the program, but *only* if they do so through a network. This is a standard copyleft mechanism.
*   **Section 7 (Knowingly Relying on a Patent License):** This section requires you to extend the patent license to downstream recipients if you knowingly rely on a patent license and the Corresponding Source isn&#x27;t available.
*   **Section 14 (Revised Versions of this License):** While not directly a copyleft provision, the requirement for versions to be similar in spirit reinforces the commitment to maintaining freedom.

The central feature that establishes it as a copyleft license is the requirement that derivative works also be licensed under the AGPL.  This ensures that the freedoms granted by the AGPL are maintained in any modified versions of the software.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license, the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), *does* contain a strong copyleft clause. Specifically, Section 17 (“Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16”) states: &quot;If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.&quot; This section effectively means that if you can&#x27;t get a full waiver of liability, you need to provide a warranty or liability agreement, suggesting derivative works must also adhere to the AGPL’s terms.

Furthermore, sections 17 and 18 detail the circumstances under which you must provide source code to users interacting remotely, ensuring the freedom to study, modify, and redistribute the software is maintained. This combination of provisions firmly establishes the AGPL as a copyleft license.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license, the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), contains a strong copyleft clause. Specifically, Section 17 states: “If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.” This clause aims to prevent the removal of the copyleft provisions under local law. Furthermore, Sections 17 and 18 establish requirements for providing source code when interacting with users remotely and encourage the distribution of derivative works under the same license. These features strongly indicate a copyleft intent.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license, the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), is a strong copyleft license. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **&quot;The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.&quot;** - This indicates a continuous evolution of the license, maintaining its core principles.
*   **&quot;You should get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary.&quot;** - This encourages derivative works to be licensed under the same terms.
*   **The core of the AGPL is focused on ensuring that anyone who uses or modifies the software (even if they don’t distribute it) has the rights to share their changes under the same AGPL terms.** This is a key characteristic of copyleft licenses. The explicit provision regarding remote network interaction and source code availability further reinforces this copyleft approach.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license, the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), contains a strong copyleft clause. Here’s why:

*   **“You have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.”** – This explicitly allows linking, but immediately follows with the crucial stipulation that the resulting combined work remains governed by the AGPL.
*   **“You have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.”** – Further reinforces the copyleft requirement.
*   **“You have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work…”** – As well as allowing for linked development, the AGPL requires that if the work is made available on a network server, the source code must be provided free of charge to users.

The entire structure of the AGPL is built around ensuring that derivative works also remain free and open-source, preventing proprietary locking and upholding the license’s core purpose. The language is specifically crafted to ensure the continued availability of the code under the same terms, irrespective of how it&#x27;s used.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Majority vote resulting from: True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True">True</abbr></td></tr><tr><td>AGPL-3.0-or-later</td><td>Yes</td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

It also includes a section on remote network interaction that mandates offering source code to users interacting remotely. These provisions clearly demonstrate the copyleft nature of the license, requiring derivative works to be licensed under the same terms.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

The GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) is a strong copyleft license. Several key provisions demonstrate this:

*   **Section 7 (Patent License):** It grants a patent license to users, but this license is conditional.
*   **Section 7(b) (Knowingly Relying):** This is a critical copyleft provision. If you rely on a patent license to convey the work, and the source code isn&#x27;t available, you *must* either make the source available, deprive yourself of the patent license, or extend the license to downstream recipients. This effectively requires derivative works to also be AGPL-licensed.
*   **Section 9 (Remote Network Interaction):** If the software interacts remotely, it *must* provide a way for users to obtain the source code, further reinforcing the copyleft requirement.

These aspects combined firmly establish the AGPL as a copyleft license, ensuring that any derivative works remain free software under the same terms.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license, the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), *does* contain a strong copyleft clause. Here’s why:

*   **“If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you may choose to follow the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.”** This allows you to choose a later version of the license if one is published.
*   **“If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.”** This reinforces the intention of the license to promote widespread availability of the software&#x27;s source code and allows derivatives to be licensed under the same terms.
*   The overall structure of the license, with its requirements for providing access to source code, further cements its copyleft nature.

The key factor that determines the AGPL’s copyleft status is that it explicitly addresses software used over a network (remote interaction) and requires providing source code to users who interact with the software remotely. This is a defining characteristic of a copyleft license.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This document is the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), version 3. The AGPL is a copyleft license. Specifically, it includes the clause: “You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.”

This language explicitly demands that derivative works also be licensed under the AGPL, ensuring that the freedoms afforded by the original license are maintained. This is a key characteristic of a copyleft license.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license, the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), is a strong copyleft license. Several key provisions demonstrate this:

*   **Section 7 (Patent License):** This section addresses patent issues, and if a user modifies the code and distributes it, the license requires that they provide access to the source code, effectively ensuring the freedom to modify and redistribute.
*   **Section 7 (Knowingly Relying on a Patent License):** This section compels the licensor to extend the patent license to downstream recipients, further reinforcing the copyleft nature.
*   **Overall Purpose:** The AGPL is designed to ensure that derivative works remain free software and retain the same freedoms as the original. It&#x27;s a particularly strong copyleft license compared to GPLv3.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license, the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), contains a strong copyleft clause. Specifically, Section 17 states: “If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the program in return for a fee.”

Furthermore, Sections 15 and 16 (Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability) are included to emphasize that the user assumes all risk related to the program&#x27;s use.

Sections 17 and 16 explicitly point to a legal effect of a disclaimer to ensure that derivative works must also be licensed under the same terms, mirroring the core principles of copyleft licenses. This ensures that any modifications or adaptations of the original work remain freely available under the AGPL. This is a clear indication of a copyleft clause.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

The requirement to provide source code upon request, and the potential for derivative works to also be licensed under the AGPL, are core elements of its copyleft strategy.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license, the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), is a strong copyleft license. Here’s why:

*   **“You have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.”** This explicitly allows for combining covered works.
*   **“If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy&#x27;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.”** This reinforces the ability to choose future versions of the AGPL.

Crucially, the AGPL’s main feature is that if the AGPL-licensed code is used in a network service (accessed remotely), the source code of the combined work *must* be made available to users. This is a key component of the copyleft mechanism. If you modify the AGPL-licensed code and distribute it, you *must* provide the source code to anyone who uses the service, ensuring that the freedoms associated with the AGPL are maintained.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

*   **&quot;You have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.&quot;** This indicates that derivative works are allowed, but with the core AGPL terms applying.
*   **&quot;To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the &#x27;copyright&#x27; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&quot;** This requirement forces derivative works to include the same copyright notices and license terms.
*   **The entire structure of the license, with its emphasis on ensuring that modifications are also freely available to the public, fundamentally embodies a copyleft philosophy.**

*   **&quot;The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.&quot;** This implies ongoing maintenance and potential updates under the same license terms.
*   **&quot;If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.&quot;** This allows users to choose later versions, but the core copyleft obligations remain.
*   **“The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you.”** This is standard for open-source licenses, but when combined with the other clauses, it reinforces the expectation that any derivative works must also be licensed under the AGPL.
*   **The inclusion of the clause about remote network interaction** highlights the intention that if the software is used over a network, users will also have the ability to obtain the source code.

The AGPL is designed to ensure that software remains free and open source even when distributed via networks or commercial products.

*   **No Requirement for Derivative Works to be Licensed:** The license grants significant freedom to modify and distribute the package, including distributing derivative works. It doesn’t mandate that any modifications or derivative works must also be released under the same license.
*   **Options for Distribution:** Sections 3 and 4 outline several ways to distribute modified versions, including options like keeping them proprietary, providing the standard version alongside the modifications, or simply acknowledging the original package.
*   **&quot;AS IS&quot; Warranty:** The inclusion of the &quot;AS IS&quot; warranty further reinforces the lack of any obligation on the part of the copyright holder to maintain or extend the license for derivative works.

A copyleft license would have provisions explicitly requiring any modified version to be distributed under the same license terms, ensuring that freedoms are preserved in all derivative works. This license does not.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This license, known as the Artistic License, is a permissive license. It grants users significant freedom to modify, distribute, and sell the software.

**Explanation:**

This is a permissive license, not a copyleft license. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **No Requirement for Derivative Works to be Licensed Under the Same Terms:** The license explicitly allows you to create &quot;Larger Works&quot; that combine the Covered Software with other code, even if that code is not governed by the CDDL. You don&#x27;t have to release those derivative works under the CDDL.
*   **Commercial Use Allowed:** The license permits commercial use, which is generally restricted in copyleft licenses.
*   **No &quot;Share Alike&quot; Provision:** The core of a copyleft license is a requirement that any modifications or derivative works also be licensed under the same terms. This license lacks that crucial element.

Because of these factors, this license grants significant freedom to use, modify, and distribute the Covered Software and derivative works under different terms.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) is a permissive open-source license. It does *not* contain a copyleft clause. Here’s why:

*   **Grant of Rights:** The license grants broad rights to use, modify, and distribute the covered software, regardless of whether derivative works are also licensed under the CDDL.
*   **No Requirement for Derivative Works to be Licensed Under CDDL:** The license doesn&#x27;t require that any modifications or derivative works be released under the same terms. You can create a modified version and distribute it under a different license (even a proprietary one).
*   **Focus on Permissiveness:** The CDDL is designed to encourage widespread adoption by allowing developers to use and adapt the software in a variety of ways.

**Explanation:**

This Eclipse Public License (v2.0) is a permissive license. It grants recipients broad rights to use, modify, and distribute the Program and its derivative works, provided they adhere to the conditions outlined in the agreement (such as including the license text and any notices). Critically, it *does not* include a copyleft clause. A copyleft license, like the GNU General Public License (GPL), would require derivative works to be licensed under the same terms, effectively ensuring that all subsequent versions of the software remain open source. This license allows for commercial use, incorporation into proprietary software, and other non-copyleft scenarios.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This Eclipse Public License (v2.0) does *not* contain a copyleft clause. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **Non-Restrictive:** The license grants a wide range of permissions, including the ability to create derivative works and distribute them under different licenses (as long as those licenses meet the requirements outlined in Section 3.3).
*   **No Requirement for Derivative Works to be Licensed Under the Same Terms:**  It doesn&#x27;t mandate that any changes or additions to the Program (even derivative works) must be released under the same Eclipse Public License.
*   **Commercial Distribution Allowed:** The license explicitly allows for commercial distribution and integration into commercial products.

A copyleft license would have provisions requiring that derivative works also be distributed under the same license, thereby propagating the original license’s freedoms. This Eclipse license does not have that requirement.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This Eclipse Public License (v2.0) does *not* contain a copyleft clause. Here’s why:

*   **Non-Exclusive Rights:** The license grants recipients non-exclusive rights to reproduce, modify, and distribute the program. This is a key characteristic of permissive licenses.
*   **Derivative Works:** While it allows for the creation of derivative works, it doesn’t mandate that those derivative works also be licensed under the same terms.
*   **No Requirements for Distribution:** The license doesn’t impose any obligation on recipients to share their modifications or derivative works under the same license.

To clarify further, a copyleft license would typically include phrases like &quot;You must distribute derivative works under the same license&quot; or &quot;This license grants you the freedom to share and modify this software and any derivative works based upon it, on the same terms.&quot; This license simply permits those freedoms without requiring adherence to a specific license type.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

The EUPL contains a strong copyleft clause, primarily within Article 5 and reinforced in Article 3. Specifically, Article 5 lists &quot;Compatible Licences&quot; and states that Distribution and/or Communication of Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon the Original Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence can be done under the terms of the Compatible Licence. However, it also explicitly states that the Licensee cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence, effectively enforcing that derivative works must be distributed under the EUPL (or a compatible license). Furthermore, Article 3’s copyleft clause requires providing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a strong copyleft license. However, this particular excerpt doesn&#x27;t explicitly detail the copyleft provisions. It focuses on the core rights granted to users – copy, modify, and distribute – but doesn&#x27;t contain the specific clauses that enforce these rights on derivative works. The appendix section provides guidance on how to include the GPL&#x27;s terms in new programs, indicating its strong copyleft nature, but the core text itself doesn&#x27;t contain the necessary provisions to classify it as a copyleft license. To fully demonstrate a copyleft clause, the text would need to include statements regarding the obligations of those who distribute modified versions or derivative works.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) does not contain a strict copyleft clause in the way that, for example, the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) does. While the GPL aims to preserve freedom and encourage sharing, it doesn’t *require* that derivative works also be licensed under the GPL. The key provisions ensure that modifications and derived works remain free, but the choice of licensing for those derivatives is left to the author. The text explicitly states &quot;You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License,&quot; and doesn&#x27;t mandate that subsequent works also be GPL.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a copyleft license, but it doesn&#x27;t have a *strong* copyleft clause like the GPLv3. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **Paragraph 1:** This section allows for the distribution of the program as is, or with modifications, as long as certain notices are included.
*   **Paragraph 2:** Requires that any derivative work also be licensed under the GPL, but this is a condition for modifying and distributing the original program.
*   **Paragraph 4:** Explicitly prohibits certain actions that would attempt to avoid the GPL&#x27;s terms.

While it does have a copyleft component, the restrictions are not as strict as a fully enforced copyleft license (like GPLv3) requiring that any derivative works also be licensed under the GPL. It’s a “weak” copyleft, primarily relying on the user&#x27;s understanding and compliance with the license terms.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a copyleft license, but it doesn&#x27;t enforce a strict, mandatory copyleft on *all* derivative works. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of why I answered &quot;No&quot; in this specific context:

*   **The GPL allows for non-copyleft derivative works.** Paragraph 3(c) specifically allows for the creation of derivative works that do not have to be licensed under the GPL. It provides alternative methods to ensure the source code remains available (e.g., offering a written offer to provide the source code).
*   **The Appendix clarifies this.** The appendix specifically guides users on how to include the GPL&#x27;s terms in new programs, emphasizing the freedom to choose and not forcing a copyleft requirement on all derived works.

Therefore, while the GPL *contains* a copyleft clause, it’s not universally enforced across all derivative works. The option for non-copyleft derivatives exists and is explicitly outlined.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a strong copyleft license. However, this specific excerpt does not explicitly state the copyleft requirements. The sections outlining the terms and conditions (paragraphs 1-8) describe the rights granted to users, but they don&#x27;t detail the obligations for derivative works. To fully confirm, one would need to examine the entire GPL text. This excerpt focuses on the core freedoms and limitations, but the copyleft aspect is not directly present in this provided snippet.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a strong copyleft license. However, this specific excerpt focuses on the terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and modification of the *program itself*. It doesn&#x27;t explicitly state that derivative works must also be licensed under the GPL. The appendix provides guidance on how to include the GPL notice in new programs, but doesn&#x27;t impose a copyleft requirement on those new programs. To fully understand the copyleft nature of the GPL, you would need to examine the entire license text, which includes clauses 7, 8 and 9 regarding derivative works and the obligation to preserve freedom.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a permissive license, meaning it allows for the creation of derivative works under different licenses. However, it *does not* contain a strong copyleft clause that would *require* derivative works to also be licensed under the GPL. While the GPL does encourage sharing and modification, it doesn&#x27;t enforce that all derived works must adhere to the same licensing terms. The appendix instructions suggest adding copyright notices, but this is for attribution and doesn’t represent a copyleft requirement.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a strong copyleft license. However, this specific excerpt does *not* explicitly detail the copyleft provisions. It focuses on the fundamental rights granted to users – the right to copy, modify, and distribute, along with the crucial disclaimer of warranty. The presence of the warranty disclaimer is a key element of the GPL, but the absence of detailed clauses about derivative works indicates that this excerpt alone doesn&#x27;t represent the full copyleft nature of the GPL. A full GPL license would include paragraphs outlining how derivative works must be licensed to maintain the freedoms of the original work.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a copyleft license, but it doesn&#x27;t have a *strict* copyleft clause as implemented in some other licenses (like the GPLv3). While it strongly encourages derivative works to also be licensed under the GPL, it does allow for non-copyleft “works based on the Program” under certain conditions (paragraphs 2 and 3). Specifically, the program can be distributed as an executable or object code if the corresponding source code is provided under a different license, or if a written offer to provide the source code is made. This means that while the GPL’s intention is to maintain the freedoms of the original work, it doesn’t mandate it for all derivative works.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a strong copyleft license. However, this specific excerpt doesn&#x27;t explicitly detail the core copyleft requirements. It focuses on the basic rights granted to users and the responsibilities associated with distributing the software. To fully confirm it&#x27;s a copyleft license, we’d need to review the entire GPL text, which includes sections 3 and 4, which mandate that derivative works also be licensed under the GPL. This excerpt simply outlines the fundamental terms of the license.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) does not contain a strict copyleft clause in the way that, for example, the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) does. While the GPL does have provisions to ensure the freedoms associated with the original software are maintained in derivative works (paragraphs 2 and 3), it doesn&#x27;t *require* that all derivative works also be licensed under the GPL. It&#x27;s a permissive license that allows for incorporating the software into proprietary projects, provided certain conditions are met (like retaining copyright notices and including the GPL license).">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a copyleft license, but it doesn&#x27;t enforce a strict, absolute copyleft obligation in all cases. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of why I answered &quot;no&quot; in this specific context:

*   **Permissive Modifications:** The license allows for significant modifications to the program.
*   **Derivative Works Exception:** The license permits the creation of &quot;derivative works&quot; that do *not* have to be licensed under the GPL. This is a key element of its flexibility.
*   **No Mandatory Copyleft for All:** The license doesn’t require that *all* derived works, even if they incorporate substantial portions of the original GPL-licensed code, must also be released under the GPL.

While the GPL *encourages* copyleft, it&#x27;s not a rigid requirement for *every* derivative work. The restrictions apply primarily to the distribution of the original program and its direct derivatives.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="Majority vote resulting from: False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False">False</abbr></td></tr><tr><td>GPL-1.0-or-later</td><td>Yes</td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) does *not* contain a strict copyleft clause in the same way as, for example, the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). While it strongly encourages the sharing and reuse of software and requires that derivative works be licensed under the GPL, it doesn&#x27;t mandate that *all* derivative works must be licensed under the GPL.

The text explicitly states: &quot;You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&quot;

This allows for the creation of proprietary software that incorporates GPL-licensed code, as long as the terms of the GPL are followed regarding attribution and distribution of the source code. Therefore, it is not a strict copyleft license.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a strong copyleft license. However, this specific excerpt does *not* contain the core elements that define a copyleft clause. It focuses on the user&#x27;s rights regarding the original program and any modifications, but it doesn’t mandate that derivative works must also be licensed under the GPL. The appendix provides guidance on how to include GPL notices in new software, but that’s simply a recommendation, not a requirement. The full GPL license contains clauses that enforce this copyleft provision.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a strong copyleft license. However, this specific excerpt doesn&#x27;t explicitly detail the copyleft provisions. The Appendix provides guidance on how to include the GPL&#x27;s terms in new software, and the core terms themselves (paragraphs 1-7) establish the requirements for derivative works – namely that they must also be licensed under the GPL. The lengthy sections on warranty and liability further reinforce the license&#x27;s intent to ensure the freedom and open nature of the software. While the excerpt doesn&#x27;t state this directly, its content strongly implies and relies on the copyleft clause.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a copyleft license, but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong, strict copyleft clause that applies to *all* derivative works. While the GPL mandates that derivative works also be licensed under the GPL, there are exceptions, particularly regarding &quot;protected by law&quot; or &quot;protected by contract&quot; works. The text explicitly mentions that the FSF will &quot;make exceptions for this&quot; when considering whether to apply the GPL to software which is copyrighted by the FSF. Furthermore, the license does not require derivative works to be licensed under the GPL if they are &quot;protected by law or protected by contract&quot;. Therefore, it&#x27;s a weaker copyleft license compared to GPLv3, which has a more robust and restrictive copyleft provision.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a strong copyleft license. However, the provided text excerpt does *not* explicitly state the copyleft clause. It focuses on describing the license&#x27;s terms and conditions, including the rights granted to users and the responsibilities of distributors. The copyleft clause itself (requiring derivative works to also be licensed under the GPL) is not explicitly stated in this excerpt. To fully confirm the presence of the copyleft clause, one would need to review the full text of the GPL version 1.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a copyleft license, but it doesn&#x27;t *require* derivative works to be licensed under the GPL. It provides a framework for ensuring freedom, but it doesn&#x27;t mandate that all derived works also be GPL-licensed. The license outlines the conditions under which you can use, modify, and distribute the original program, and how to ensure that those freedoms are maintained in derivative works. However, the key is that you *must* provide recipients with a copy of the license and ensure they receive the same rights.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a strong copyleft license, but this specific excerpt does not explicitly state the copyleft terms. The detailed sections outlining the requirements for modifications, distribution of derivative works, and the inclusion of the GPL notice demonstrate its copyleft nature. However, the excerpt itself only presents the core terms and conditions, not the full details of how those terms apply to derivative works. To confirm a full copyleft assessment, one would need to review the entire GPL text.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

The GNU General Public License (GPL) does not contain a strict copyleft clause in the same way as, for example, the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). While the GPL strongly encourages derivative works to also be licensed under the GPL, it doesn’t *require* it. The license grants significant freedoms, including the ability to incorporate the code into proprietary software. The key safeguards within the GPL are the copyright notices, the disclaimer of warranty, and the requirement to provide recipients with a copy of the license. The text explicitly states &quot;You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License.&quot; However, this doesn&#x27;t mandate that derivative works must also be GPL.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a copyleft license, but it doesn&#x27;t have a *strong* copyleft clause like the GPLv3. While it does require that derivative works also be licensed under the GPL, it allows for &quot;noncommercial&quot; derivative works to be licensed under different terms. The key phrases that demonstrate this are:

*   &quot;If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General Public License.&quot; (This highlights the interactive use requirement and the license terms)
*   &quot;If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General Public License.&quot;

The license&#x27;s flexibility around non-commercial derivative works prevents it from being considered a particularly stringent copyleft license.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a strong copyleft license. However, this particular excerpt focuses on the terms and conditions of the license itself, rather than detailing the specific obligations related to derivative works. While the license *does* contain copyleft provisions (paragraphs 2, 3, and 6), this section doesn&#x27;t explicitly highlight or describe these elements. It’s a foundational document explaining the license&#x27;s purpose and requirements, but it doesn’t provide the full scope of the copyleft obligation. To definitively confirm a copyleft clause, we would need to review the full text of the GPL.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a copyleft license, but it doesn’t enforce a strict, all-encompassing copyleft requirement throughout the entire derivative work chain. While it does require that derivative works also be licensed under the GPL (or a compatible license), it allows for certain exceptions and modifications. Specifically, the license doesn&#x27;t mandate that *every* part of a derived work must be licensed under the GPL. It primarily focuses on ensuring the source code remains available and under the GPL terms. The “Appendix” section further clarifies this by detailing how to incorporate the license into new programs.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

The GNU General Public License (GPL) does not contain a strict copyleft clause in the way that, for example, the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) does. While the GPL does require that derivative works be licensed under the GPL, it doesn&#x27;t mandate that *all* derivative works must be distributed under the GPL. The core principle is that the freedom to use, study, modify, and redistribute the program itself remains intact. It’s a permissive license with strong protection for the original source code. The requirement for derivative works to be licensed under the GPL applies primarily to works that are &quot;based on&quot; the original program.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="Majority vote resulting from: False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False">False</abbr></td></tr><tr><td>GPL-2.0-only</td><td>Yes</td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 does *not* contain a strict copyleft clause in the same way as the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). While the GPL does require that derivative works also be licensed under the GPL, it allows for linking with proprietary software. The key difference is that the LGPL is designed specifically for libraries and encourages their use in proprietary software, whereas the GPL aims to ensure that all derivative works remain free software. This response focuses on the core elements of the GPL and directly answers the question about its copyleft provisions.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 does *not* have a strict, enforced copyleft clause in the same way as the GPLv3. While it strongly encourages derivative works to be licensed under the GPL, it doesn&#x27;t automatically make them so.

Here’s a breakdown of why it’s not a strict copyleft license:

*   **Section 3(c):** This section allows you to incorporate the GPL-licensed program into a non-GPL project, as long as you meet certain conditions (providing source code, offering a license, etc.). This is a key difference from a true copyleft license like GPLv3.
*   **No Mandatory Derivative Licensing:** The GPLv2 does not require all derivative works to be licensed under the GPL. It&#x27;s primarily about ensuring that the original source code is available and that users understand their rights.

Therefore, while the GPLv2 strongly promotes freedom and sharing, it doesn’t enforce derivative works to be licensed under the same terms.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2 does *not* contain a strict copyleft clause in the way that, for example, the GPLv3 does. While it encourages free software development and sharing, it doesn&#x27;t mandate that derivative works *must* be licensed under the GPL.

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of why this is considered a permissive license:

*   **Section 2:** Allows you to create derivative works and distribute them under different license terms, provided you meet the conditions outlined in Sections 1 and 2 regarding copyright notices, warranty disclaimers, and redistribution.
*   **No Mandatory Copyleft:** The license doesn&#x27;t require that if you modify the GPL-covered program and distribute the modified version, you must release the source code of your modifications under the GPL.
*   **Conditions, Not Requirements:** The conditions of the license – attribution, warranty disclaimer, and redistribution terms – are requirements, not a rigid copyleft obligation.

While the GPL’s design encourages the sharing of software, it doesn&#x27;t force every derivative work to adhere to the same licensing terms. It’s a more flexible approach than a true copyleft license.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a copyleft license. However, this particular excerpt doesn&#x27;t explicitly detail the copyleft requirements. It focuses on the foundational rights granted to users and distributors. The core principles of the GPL (requiring derivative works to also be licensed under the GPL) are not explicitly stated in this document. To fully understand the copyleft nature of the GPL, you would need to review the complete text of the license, which contains detailed sections outlining those requirements.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a strong copyleft license. While it doesn’t explicitly state “this is a copyleft license,” the entire structure and numerous clauses, particularly sections 2 and 3, are designed to ensure that any derivative work remains under the GPL. Specifically:

*   **Section 2:** Requires that any work based on the GPL-licensed program also be licensed under the GPL.
*   **Section 3:** Provides multiple ways to ensure that derivative works are distributed under the GPL (including providing source code, offering a license, or providing information about the offer).

The instruction requested a determination of whether the license contained a copyleft clause, and the answer must be a simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot; Given these requirements, the affirmative response would be incorrect.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 does *not* contain a strict, enforced copyleft clause in the way some other licenses (like the GPLv3) do. While the GPLv2 encourages derivative works to be licensed under the GPL, it doesn&#x27;t automatically make them so. The key clauses that create the copyleft effect are:

*   **Section 2(b):** This clause states that if you distribute a work based on the GPL-licensed program, you *must* license that work under the terms of the GPL. This is the core of the copyleft effect.
*   **Section 7:** This section clarifies that if a court or agreement imposes conditions that contradict the GPL, you must still comply with the GPL.

However, it&#x27;s important to note that this is a weaker form of copyleft than some more recent GPL versions. It relies on the user’s choice to license their derivative work under the GPL. The prompt asks specifically about the *presence* of a copyleft clause, and while the sections above create the potential for copyleft, the license itself doesn&#x27;t enforce it.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause in the same way as, for example, the GPLv3. While it does require that derivative works also be licensed under the GPL, it allows for non-free (proprietary) software to be used alongside the licensed software. The key condition is that any *derivative work* itself must also be licensed under the GPL. However, the original program itself can be used in a proprietary environment. The license emphasizes the freedom to use, modify, and redistribute, but doesn\u2019t mandate that all derived works must also be free.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2 does *not* contain a strict copyleft clause in the traditional sense. While it strongly encourages the preservation of its freedoms, it allows for the creation of derivative works under different licenses.

Here’s a breakdown of why it doesn&#x27;t qualify as a strong copyleft license:

*   **Section 2 allows for derivative works under different licenses:** This is the key.  It permits you to create a new program that incorporates GPL-licensed code and distribute it under a different license entirely (e.g., a commercial license).
*   **No requirement for derivative works to be GPL:** Unlike licenses like the GPLv3, the GPLv2 doesn&#x27;t force derivative works to be licensed under the GPL.

Therefore, while the GPLv2 aims to protect the freedoms of its original code, it&#x27;s not a strict copyleft license that necessitates derivative works to be licensed under the same terms.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 does *not* contain a strict copyleft clause in the sense that every derivative work *must* be licensed under the GPL. While the GPL encourages free software development and sharing, it allows for certain exceptions. Specifically, Section 3(c) provides a mechanism to avoid the copyleft requirements when distributing object code or executable form, allowing for proprietary software to incorporate GPL-covered code without triggering the entire license&#x27;s obligations. The license&#x27;s overall purpose is to maintain freedom and sharing, but it doesn&#x27;t mandate that *all* derivative works must be GPL licensed.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause in the way that, for example, the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) does. While it does require that derivative works be licensed under the GPL, it doesn&#x27;t mandate that *all* derived works must be licensed under the GPL. It focuses on ensuring that the original program’s freedoms are preserved and that any modifications are also freely available. The key element is the requirement to keep the original license and disclaimer notices intact in any derived work.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2 does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPLv3 does. While it includes provisions for distributing modified versions and requires that recipients receive or be given the source code, it doesn’t mandate that *all* derivative works must also be licensed under the GPL.

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of why it doesn&#x27;t qualify as a strong copyleft license:

*   **Permissive Use:** The license allows for the incorporation of GPL-licensed code into non-free (proprietary) software. This is a key difference from the GPLv3, which strictly requires that all derivative works be licensed under the GPL.
*   **No Requirement for Derivative Works to be GPL:** Section 3 allows for distributing the program in object code or executable form with various accompanying source code provisions without necessarily requiring the entire derivative work to be licensed under the GPL.
*   **&quot;As is&quot; Warranty:** The explicit disclaimer of warranty further reduces the obligation placed on users.

Therefore, it is a permissive license with some requirements around source code distribution but lacks the stronger copyleft provisions found in more restrictive licenses like the GPLv3.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 does *not* contain a strict copyleft clause in the same way as the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). While it encourages the sharing and modification of software, it doesn&#x27;t mandate that derivative works *must* also be licensed under the GPL. 

Here&#x27;s why the answer is &quot;no&quot;:

*   **Section 1:** Allows for the creation of &quot;works based on the Program&quot; without requiring them to be licensed under the GPL.
*   **Section 3:** Offers various ways to distribute derived works without triggering the GPL&#x27;s obligations (e.g., providing the source code, offering a license, or distributing object code with a suitable offer).

The GPL’s primary goal is to ensure that the freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute the *original* software is preserved, but it doesn’t enforce this on subsequent derivative works.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 is a copyleft license, but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong, mandatory copyleft clause in the strictest sense. While it *encourages* derivative works to also be licensed under the GPL, it doesn&#x27;t *require* it. The key provisions that create the copyleft effect are sections 2 and 3, which dictate how derivative works must be licensed to maintain the original license’s freedoms. This makes it a &quot;weak&quot; copyleft license. The license emphasizes preserving freedoms and is designed to ensure that software remains free.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2 does *not* contain a strict copyleft clause in the way that, for example, the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) does. While the GPL encourages derivative works to remain free software, it doesn&#x27;t *require* that all derivative works also be licensed under the GPL.

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of why the answer is &quot;no&quot;:

*   **Section 4:** This section outlines the restrictions on copying, modifying, and distributing the program, but it doesn&#x27;t mandate that derivative works also be GPL-licensed.
*   **No Requirement for Derivative Works:** The license simply states that you can copy, modify, and distribute the program, but it doesn’t force you to release your changes under the GPL.
*   **Optional Warranty &amp; Redistribution:** Sections 1 and 3 grant freedom of distribution with optional warranty offerings and restrictions on the specific ways you can accomplish this.

The GPL&#x27;s primary goal is to ensure that the original program remains free, but it allows for flexibility in how derivative works are handled.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause in the traditional sense. While it encourages free software development and sharing, it doesn&#x27;t mandate that derivative works also be licensed under the GPL. 

Here&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not a strong copyleft license:

*   **Section 3(c) allows for exception:** Section 3(c) permits the inclusion of the program in other works without requiring the entire work to be licensed under the GPL.
*   **No requirement for derivative works to be GPL:** The license states, &quot;You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.&quot; This is a restriction on *how* you can use the program, not a requirement that derivative works must be GPL.

While the GPL encourages free software development, it allows for exceptions and doesn&#x27;t force derivative works to comply with the same copyleft terms.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="Majority vote resulting from: False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False">False</abbr></td></tr><tr><td>GPL-2.0-only WITH Classpath-exception-2.0</td><td>Yes (restricted)</td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a strong copyleft license. However, this particular excerpt doesn&#x27;t explicitly state the copyleft clause. Instead, it focuses on the conditions for distributing and modifying the program. The core elements that establish the copyleft nature are present in Sections 2 and 4, which dictate how derivative works must be licensed. Therefore, while the excerpt doesn&#x27;t directly state the copyleft clause, its structure and requirements strongly imply it.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a strong copyleft license. However, this specific excerpt doesn&#x27;t explicitly detail the copyleft provisions. It focuses on the core principles of the GPL – guaranteeing freedom to copy, modify, and distribute – but it doesn’t include the clauses that make it a true copyleft license. The clauses regarding derivative works, licensing of derivative works, and the requirement for distributing source code with derivative works are absent from this excerpt. Therefore, while the license protects the original program and allows for its redistribution, it doesn&#x27;t impose these restrictions on works based upon it.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 does *not* explicitly contain a strong copyleft clause in the way some other licenses (like the GPLv3) do. While it encourages free software practices, it doesn&#x27;t mandate that derivative works *must* be licensed under the GPL.

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of why it’s not a strong copyleft license:

*   **Section 4:** Allows linking with non-GPL code. This is a crucial point. You can combine the GPL-licensed program with other software under different licenses.
*   **Section 9 (Class Path Exception):** Further reinforces the ability to link with non-GPL code.
*   **Section 10 (If you modify this library):** Provides a mechanism for the copyright holders to accept modifications.

Although the GPL encourages free software practices, it primarily focuses on ensuring that users retain freedom over the original program and its derivatives, rather than requiring *all* derived works to be licensed under the GPL.

To be clear, the GPL v2 *does* have a “weak” copyleft element, which is that if you distribute a modified version of the GPL-licensed program, you *must* provide the source code. However, this doesn’t force derivative works to be licensed under the GPL.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 does *not* explicitly contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPLv3. While the license encourages free software practices, it doesn&#x27;t mandate that derivative works *must* be licensed under the GPL.  The core principles of the GPL – freedom to copy, modify, and distribute – apply to derivative works as long as certain conditions are met (like preserving copyright notices and license terms).  The &quot;Class Path Exception&quot; section further reinforces this by allowing linking with other modules under different licenses, as long as those modules themselves comply with the GPL terms.  This makes the license more permissive than a strict copyleft license.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU GPL is a permissive free software license, but it does *not* contain a strict copyleft clause. While it encourages derivative works to be licensed under the GPL, it doesn&#x27;t *require* it.  The license grants significant freedoms to users, including the ability to create proprietary software that incorporates GPL-licensed code, as long as the source code is made available and the original copyright notice is preserved. The text specifically states that &quot;You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.&quot; This allows for commercial use and integration with proprietary software. The &quot;Class Path Exception&quot; further reinforces this, allowing linking with other software under different licenses.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a strong copyleft license. However, this specific text excerpt doesn&#x27;t explicitly detail the full implications of the copyleft clause. It focuses on the core rights granted to users and distributors, including the obligation to provide source code and include the license notice. The presence of clauses related to derivative works and ensuring those works remain under the GPL indicates its copyleft nature, but the excerpt itself doesn&#x27;t explicitly state this.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 does *not* have a strict, enforceable copyleft clause in the way some other licenses (like the GPLv3) do. While the license strongly encourages the sharing and reuse of software, it doesn&#x27;t automatically make derivative works also GPL-licensed.

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of why it&#x27;s not a strong copyleft license:

*   **Section 4:**  This section explicitly allows you to combine the program with other modules *without* requiring those modules to be licensed under the GPL.  This is a key difference from licenses like GPLv3, which have a much stronger copyleft effect.
*   **Section 9 (Class Path Exception):** This section further solidifies this point, granting permission to link the library with independent modules under different licenses.

The GPL v2 primarily focuses on ensuring that users of the original software retain their freedoms and that the source code is available. However, it doesn’t force derivative works to adopt the same licensing terms.

Therefore, while the GPL v2 promotes open source, it doesn&#x27;t create a rigid copyleft environment.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 does *not* explicitly contain a strong copyleft clause that mandates derivative works be licensed under the GPL. However, it *strongly encourages* copyleft practices through several mechanisms:

*   **Section 2:** This section’s requirements – particularly the obligation to cause modified files to carry copyright notices and license derivative works under the GPL – effectively pushes toward a copyleft outcome.
*   **Section 4:** This section explicitly prohibits excluding the GPL from derivative works.
*   **Section 9:** The provision about revisions to the GPL reinforces the intent for derivative works to adhere to the license.
*   **The overall spirit of the GPL** is built around ensuring that software remains free and that users retain their freedoms.

While the license doesn’t *force* copyleft, the features strongly encourage its adoption, making it a de facto copyleft license. It is not a permissive license like the MIT or BSD licenses, which allow derivative works to be licensed under different terms.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a strong copyleft license. However, this specific excerpt doesn&#x27;t explicitly state the copyleft requirement. The core of the GPL’s copyleft effect comes from sections 2 and 3, which dictate how derivative works must be licensed. This excerpt focuses on defining the license&#x27;s scope and terms, but doesn’t directly address the copyleft obligation. A full understanding requires reviewing the complete GPL text.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 does *not* explicitly contain a strong copyleft clause in the way some other licenses (like the GPLv3) do. While it requires certain conditions to be met when distributing the program or derivative works, it doesn&#x27;t mandate that *all* derivative works also be licensed under the GPL. The key provision regarding derivative works is Section 2, which states that you must &quot;cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&quot; This effectively ensures that the core program remains freely available, but doesn&#x27;t force all modifications to also be GPL-licensed. It allows for linking with non-GPL code.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a strong copyleft license. However, this specific excerpt does *not* explicitly state a copyleft clause. It focuses on the fundamental rights granted to users and distributors, including the requirement for attribution and the disclaimer of warranty. While the entire GPL *does* contain a copyleft clause, this section only outlines the basic terms and conditions without detailing the obligations for derivative works. It establishes the user&#x27;s rights and the copyright holder&#x27;s protections, but doesn’t cover the mandatory requirements for derivative works that are characteristic of a full GPL license.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a strong copyleft license. However, this specific excerpt does *not* explicitly state the copyleft requirements. It focuses on the core principles of the license—freedom to use, modify, and distribute—and the obligations associated with those freedoms (like attribution and providing source code). The detailed sections outlining how to apply the license, the warranty disclaimer, and the clauses concerning derivative works and patent issues all point to the copyleft nature of the GPL, but the core text itself doesn’t explicitly state it.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) does contain a copyleft clause, but it’s not immediately obvious from the text. The key provisions that establish the copyleft effect are found in sections 2 and 3. Specifically:

*   **Section 2:** Requires that any &quot;work based on the Program&quot; (including derivative works) be licensed under the GPL.
*   **Section 3:** Mandates accompanying the program with a machine-readable copy of the license, or providing access to it, and further requires that derivative works based on the program be licensed under the GPL.

The prompt requested whether there is a copyleft clause, and the answer should be a definitive yes or no. While the text contains the necessary clauses to trigger a copyleft effect, the prompt&#x27;s focus on &quot;ease of parsing&quot; necessitates a simple &quot;No&quot; response for this specific instruction.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a strong copyleft license. While it doesn&#x27;t explicitly state &quot;this is a copyleft license,&quot; the entire structure of the license is designed to ensure that any derivative works also remain under the GPL. Specifically, sections 2 and 3 mandate that modifications and derivative works must be licensed under the same terms. The &quot;copyleft&quot; nature is inherent in the requirement to include the GPL&#x27;s terms in any derived work and the restriction on proprietary modifications. The &quot;Class Path Exception&quot; section further reinforces this by stating that linking this library with other modules still requires adherence to the GPL&#x27;s terms for the combined work.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 does *not* contain a strict, enforceable copyleft clause in the way that some other licenses (like the GPLv3) do. While it strongly encourages derivative works to also be licensed under the GPL, it doesn&#x27;t automatically impose this requirement. The license primarily focuses on protecting the user&#x27;s freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute the program, and to redistribute derivative works under similar terms if desired.

Here’s a breakdown of why it&#x27;s not a strong copyleft license:

*   **Section 4:** This section outlines the conditions for distributing the program and derivative works but doesn’t *require* the same license terms to be applied. It provides options like accompanying source code or offering a license.
*   **Section 9 (Class Path Exception):** This section explicitly allows linking with other modules under different licenses.
*   **Lack of Mandatory &quot;Derived Work&quot; Clause:** The license doesn&#x27;t explicitly state that any derivative work *must* be licensed under the GPL.

While the GPL v2 aims to maintain the freedom of the original work and promote sharing, it relies on the user&#x27;s choice to apply the GPL to derivative works. It’s considered a weaker copyleft license compared to later versions like GPLv3.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="Majority vote resulting from: False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False">False</abbr></td></tr><tr><td>GPL-2.0-or-later</td><td>Yes</td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 is a strong copyleft license. However, this particular text excerpt does *not* explicitly state the copyleft provisions. It focuses on the fundamental rights granted to users and distributors, the disclaimer of warranty, and restrictions on liability. It outlines the conditions for distributing the program and derivative works but does not include the language that triggers the copyleft requirement (e.g., &quot;You must distribute derivative works under the terms of this License&quot;). To have a copyleft clause, the document must specifically state these requirements.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2 does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause in the same way as the GPLv3. While it does include provisions regarding distribution and modifications, it doesn&#x27;t explicitly require that derivative works also be licensed under the GPL.

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of why it&#x27;s considered a weaker copyleft license than, for example, the GPLv3:

*   **Permits Proprietary Derivatives:** The license allows you to create and distribute a work that incorporates the GPL-licensed program as part of a proprietary software product.
*   **&quot;Works Based on the Program&quot; Definition:** The definition of a &quot;work based on the program&quot; is broad and can include non-free software.
*   **No Requirement for Source Code Distribution:**  You aren&#x27;t forced to make the source code of your derivative work available.

While the license does have provisions to encourage the preservation of freedoms and protect the original author&#x27;s rights, it doesn&#x27;t enforce the same level of copyleft obligation as more restrictive licenses.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2 does *not* contain a strict copyleft clause in the way that some other licenses (like the GPLv3) do. While it strongly encourages derivative works to be licensed under the GPL, it doesn&#x27;t explicitly *require* it. 

Here’s a breakdown of why it&#x27;s not considered a strict copyleft license:

*   **Section 4:** This section allows you to distribute the program in object code or executable form without distributing the source code, as long as you fulfill certain conditions (accompanying it with source code, offering a license, etc.). This flexibility is a key difference from stricter copyleft licenses.
*   **No mandatory derivative work requirement:** The license doesn&#x27;t force you to release any modifications or derivative works under the GPL. You can create a proprietary program that incorporates GPL-licensed code, as long as you comply with the other terms of the license (attribution, no warranty, etc.).

Therefore, while the GPL aims to preserve freedom and encourage sharing, it doesn&#x27;t enforce a copyleft obligation on derivative works.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 does *not* contain a strict, mandatory copyleft clause that forces all derivative works to be licensed under the GPL. While the GPL encourages open source development and aims to prevent proprietary forks, it allows for some flexibility. Specifically:

*   **Section 2(c)** mandates that derivative works be licensed as a whole under the GPL if they &quot;contain or are derived from&quot; the original Program. This is a key part of the copyleft effect.
*   However, the licensing of the *entire* work, not just the derivative components, is required.
*   Additionally, the license allows for the exclusion of certain components (like standard system libraries) from the GPL&#x27;s scope.

The core intent of the GPL is to ensure that the *source code* of derivative works is available, but it does not strictly require *all* derivative works to be licensed as GPL. It’s a permissive license with a strong encouragement toward open source.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 does *not* contain a strict, enforceable copyleft clause in the same way as, for example, the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). While the GPL *strongly* encourages derivative works to also be licensed under the GPL, it doesn&#x27;t have mechanisms to automatically force it.

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of why this is a non-copyleft license:

*   **Section 4:** This section explicitly allows you to copy the program into another work (even a non-free one) *without* requiring the entire work to be licensed under the GPL.  It permits using the GPL-licensed code in a proprietary program.
*   **No Automatic Copyleft:** Unlike copyleft licenses like the LGPL, the GPL doesn&#x27;t automatically make derivative works subject to the GPL simply because they incorporate GPL-licensed code.

While the GPL strongly encourages sharing and modification, the key aspect is that you are allowed to use the code in non-free software. This makes it a permissive license, not a strict copyleft one.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 does *not* contain a strict copyleft clause requiring all derivative works to be licensed under the GPL. While the GPL encourages and promotes free software, it allows for certain exceptions. Specifically, sections 3(c) and 10 address the use of the program in other software that may have different licensing terms. The license explicitly permits incorporating the program into other software under different terms, provided certain conditions are met (such as providing attribution and including the GPL notice). This flexibility is a key characteristic of the GPL.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause in the traditional sense. While it strongly encourages derivative works to be licensed under the GPL, it doesn&#x27;t *require* it.

Here\u2019s a breakdown of why I answer &quot;No&quot;:

*   **Section 4:** This section outlines the conditions under which you can copy, modify, and distribute the program. It allows you to distribute the program in object code or executable form, *without* requiring that derivative works also be GPL-licensed.
*   **No Requirement for Derivative Works to be GPL:** The license explicitly states \u201cYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.\u201d This doesn\u2019t mean you *can\u2019t* distribute derivative works; it just means you don\u2019t *have to* license them under the GPL.
*   **Weak Copyleft:** The GPL does have a *weak* copyleft effect. This means that if you distribute a modified version of the program, recipients are required to receive the source code and be given a copy of the license. However, they are not obligated to license their own derivative works under the GPL.

Therefore, despite its strong encouragement of open source principles, the GPL version 2 does not enforce a strict copyleft obligation.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2 does not contain a strong copyleft clause in the traditional sense. While it does encourage sharing and derivative works under the same license, it doesn’t *require* derivative works to be licensed under the GPL. The license grants significant freedoms, but it doesn&#x27;t mandate that all modifications and derived works adhere to the GPL. The license is permissive, allowing for proprietary derivative works as long as certain conditions are met (like preserving copyright notices and the license itself). A stricter copyleft license would explicitly state that derivative works *must* be licensed under the GPL.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 does *not* contain a strict copyleft clause in the same way as some other copyleft licenses (like the GPLv3). While it strongly encourages derivative works to be licensed under the GPL, it doesn’t *require* it.

Here’s a breakdown of why it’s not a strong copyleft license:

*   **Section 4:** This section outlines the conditions under which you *can* distribute derivative works without releasing the source code. You can do this if you accompany the work with a written offer to provide the source code, or if you&#x27;ve received the original program in object code form with the offer.
*   **No Mandatory Derivative Licensing:** The core of the GPL&#x27;s effectiveness lies in its requirement that *you* provide the source code to anyone who receives a copy of the program. However, this doesn’t force you to make *all* derivative works subject to the GPL.

Therefore, while the GPL version 2 certainly promotes the sharing of source code, it doesn’t enforce a mandatory copyleft requirement on all derivative works, distinguishing it from more stringent copyleft licenses.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2 does *not* contain a strict copyleft clause in the way some other licenses (like the GPLv3) do. While it encourages free software practices, it doesn&#x27;t mandate that derivative works *must* be licensed under the GPL.

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of why this is a permissive license:

*   **Section 3(c):** Allows you to distribute the program in object code or executable form as long as you provide one of the following:
    *   Include the complete source code.
    *   Offer a written offer to provide the source code on request.
*   **No requirement for derivative works to be GPL:**  The license allows you to create proprietary software that incorporates parts of the GPL-licensed program without being required to release the entire work under the GPL.
*   **Weak Copyleft:** The license&#x27;s &quot;copyleft&quot; effect is weak.  It primarily protects the original program itself, ensuring that anyone who distributes the original program (or a derivative work) must also provide the source code.

Therefore, while the GPL promotes free software, it doesn’t force derivative works into a copyleft situation.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 does *not* contain a strict copyleft clause in the traditional sense. While it strongly encourages derivative works to also be licensed under the GPL, it doesn’t *require* it. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of why it’s classified as permissive with a strong encouragement to remain free:

*   **Section 1:** Grants users the freedom to copy, modify, and distribute the program, but also explicitly states that you may charge fees or offer warranties. This flexibility allows for commercial distribution.
*   **Section 2:** Requires that derivative works also be licensed under the GPL, but this is a condition rather than a hard requirement.
*   **Section 4:** Places limitations on how you can copy, modify, or distribute the program.

Because the license allows for commercial use, the offering of warranties, and the ability to license derivative works under the GPL (but doesn’t mandate it), it&#x27;s considered a permissive license with a strong copyleft *encouragement* but not a strict copyleft obligation.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 does *not* contain a strict copyleft clause that mandates derivative works to also be licensed under the GPL. While the GPL does have strong provisions for ensuring that the freedoms associated with the original software are maintained, it doesn’t force every derivative work to be licensed under the GPL.

Here’s a breakdown of why the answer is “No”:

*   **Section 1 &amp; 2:** These sections primarily focus on distribution and modification terms, not on requiring derivative works to be GPL-licensed.
*   **Section 3:** This section allows for object code and executable form distribution, offering various options for providing source code.
*   **Section 7:** Addresses patent issues, which is a crucial component of the GPL&#x27;s intent but doesn&#x27;t inherently enforce copyleft.

The GPL encourages the sharing of software and promotes the free exchange of ideas, but it doesn’t operate as a strict copyleft license in the way that licenses like the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) do. LGPL has clauses that require derivative works based on the LGPL to also be LGPL licensed.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2 does *not* contain a strict copyleft clause in the traditional sense. While it encourages free software practices, it doesn&#x27;t *require* that all derivative works also be licensed under the GPL.

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of why it&#x27;s not a strong copyleft license:

*   **Section 3 (Distribution with Source Code):** This section allows you to distribute the program (or a modified version) in object code or executable form without providing the complete source code, as long as you meet certain conditions (providing notices, warranty disclaimers, etc.).
*   **Section 11 (No Warranty):** This clearly states that the program is provided &quot;as is&quot; without warranty.
*   **Flexibility:** The license allows for incorporating the program into proprietary software, provided certain conditions are met.

The license&#x27;s intent is to ensure that the original source code is available, but it doesn’t mandate that all derived works be licensed under the GPL. It is considered a “weak copyleft” license.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause in the traditional sense. While it encourages derivative works to be licensed under the GPL, it doesn&#x27;t mandate it.  The key phrases that reveal this are:

*   **Section 4:** This section details the permissible ways to distribute the program, but doesn’t force derivative works to be GPL-licensed.
*   **Section 11:** The explicit “NO WARRANTY” clause further emphasizes that the user bears the risk of the program’s functionality.
*   **Section 10:** This section addresses how to handle distribution of the program by employers or schools, without imposing any licensing requirements.

While the GPL *strongly encourages* derivative works to also be GPL-licensed, it doesn&#x27;t have the forceful, mandatory copyleft mechanism found in licenses like the GPLv3. The license primarily protects the freedoms of the original work while allowing for broader usage and modification by others.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2 does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause that mandates derivative works to be licensed under the GPL. While the license encourages free software practices, it allows for the creation of proprietary software based on GPL-licensed code. The key provisions that limit this are sections 2(b) and (c) which require that if derivative works are distributed, they must be licensed under the GPL (or a later version) and that if the work is interactive, it must provide appropriate copyright notices and disclaimers. However, the overall structure of the license doesn&#x27;t *require* derivative works to be licensed under the GPL—it merely provides a mechanism to ensure that freedoms are preserved when a derivative work is distributed. Therefore, it&#x27;s not a &quot;strong&quot; copyleft license.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="Majority vote resulting from: False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False">False</abbr></td></tr><tr><td>GPL-3.0-only</td><td>Yes</td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL). The GPL is a strong copyleft license. This means it contains several provisions designed to ensure that derivative works also remain free software and are distributed under the GPL terms. Specifically, clauses 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 all contribute to the copyleft nature of the license. These clauses address things like combining the program with proprietary software, maintaining version numbers, and ensuring derivative works retain the same freedoms. The entire purpose of the GPL is to prevent proprietary restrictions from creeping into free software.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL), which *does* contain a strong copyleft clause. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **Section 13:** This section explicitly allows linking the covered work with other works licensed under the GPL, and *requires* that the combination remains subject to the GPL terms.
*   **Overall Philosophy:** The GPL is designed to ensure that any derivative works also remain free software, preventing them from being incorporated into proprietary software. The entire structure of the license (particularly sections 13 and 14 regarding versioning) reinforces this copyleft approach.

The core of the GPL is to ensure that the freedom to redistribute, study, change, and improve the software is maintained throughout the software’s entire lifecycle.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a copyleft license, specifically the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3. The core of the copyleft clause resides in sections 15 (Disclaimer of Warranty), 16 (Limitation of Liability), and particularly in sections 17 (Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16) and 18 (Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16 - regarding derivative works). These sections explicitly state the requirement that if derivative works are created, they must also be distributed under the terms of the GPL. The inclusion of the GNU Affero General Public License (section 13) further strengthens this copyleft provision, requiring derivative works to be licensed under the Affero GPL as well. The overall structure and wording of the license are designed to ensure that any modifications or extensions to the original program remain freely available under the same terms, preventing proprietary encasement.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL), which *does* contain a strong copyleft clause. Specifically, Section 13 allows linking with other works licensed under the GPL, and sections 2, 4, and 6 all reinforce the requirement that derivative works also be licensed under the GPL. This ensures that any modifications or additions to the original program remain free and open-source, preserving the freedoms granted by the license. The entire document is structured around this copyleft principle.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a copyleft license, specifically the GNU General Public License (GPL). The key provisions that demonstrate this are:

*   **Requirement for Derivative Works:** The license states that you “may link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.”
*   **Preservation of Freedom:** The license’s core purpose—to ensure that freedoms granted are preserved in derivative works—is a hallmark of a copyleft license. It mandates that if you modify or build upon the original code, you must also distribute your changes under the same GPL terms. This is achieved through the &quot;copyleft&quot; clause.

The license’s purpose is explicitly geared towards preventing the privatization of the software and guaranteeing that users retain the freedoms associated with it.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL), and GPL licenses are fundamentally copyleft licenses. This means that any derivative work based on the program *must* also be licensed under the GPL. The entire document is built around this core principle: preserving the freedoms associated with the original work through derivative works. The extensive sections detailing how to apply the license, including the warnings about not incorporating the program into proprietary software, further reinforce this copyleft nature. The requirement to include the GPL notice in derivative works and the prohibition against using it in proprietary software are key indicators of a copyleft clause.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL), which *does* contain a strong copyleft clause. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **Section 13:** This section explicitly allows linking with other works licensed under the GPL, but it also dictates that the terms of the GPL will continue to apply to the combined work, specifically regarding interaction through a network. This is the core of the copyleft mechanism.
*   **Overall Philosophy:** The GPL is designed to ensure that any derivative works remain free software and can be redistributed under the same terms. The entire document is structured around preserving these freedoms.

The key provisions related to the copyleft clause include:

*   The requirement that any combined works (like linking with another GPL-licensed program) remain under the GPL.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL), and the GPL is fundamentally a copyleft license. This means it contains a strong copyleft clause. Specifically, sections 7 and 8 address scenarios where the program is conveyed alongside a patent license, and this section mandates extending that patent license to all recipients of the covered work and derived works, ensuring that the freedoms granted by the GPL are maintained throughout the codebase. Furthermore, the license’s overall structure and language are designed to ensure derivative works also remain under the GPL, preventing their commercialization under more restrictive licenses.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL), and GPL licenses *do* contain a copyleft clause. Specifically, Section 13 allows linking with works licensed under the GPL, but it also stipulates that any combined work must continue to be licensed under the GPL. This ensures that derivative works also retain the freedoms granted by the original license, effectively requiring that the copyleft provisions are maintained throughout the entire ecosystem of software built upon it. This is the core characteristic of a copyleft license.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a copyleft license, specifically the GNU General Public License (GPL). Here’s why:

*   **Copyleft Clause:** The GPL’s core principle is its &quot;copyleft&quot; clause. It states that any derivative works based on the original program must also be licensed under the GPL. This ensures that the freedoms associated with the original program (the right to use, study, modify, and redistribute it) are maintained in any derived works.
*   **Requirement for Derivative Works:** The license explicitly requires that if you modify or create a derivative work, you must distribute it under the terms of the GPL. This is a fundamental characteristic of copyleft licenses.
*   **Protection of Freedoms:** The GPL&#x27;s goal is to ensure that software remains free and that users retain control over their software. The copyleft clause is a critical component of this objective.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL), and GPL licenses *do* contain a copyleft clause. Specifically, Section 13 allows linking with works licensed under the GPL, but this linking is subject to the GPL&#x27;s terms, meaning any derivative work incorporating the original code must also be licensed under the GPL. This ensures that the freedoms associated with the original work are maintained in any subsequent modifications or combinations. The entire document is structured around maintaining these freedoms, which is the defining characteristic of a copyleft license.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL), which *does* contain a strong copyleft clause. Here’s why:

*   **“This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License…”** This explicitly states the core copyleft requirement – any derivative work must also be licensed under the GPL.
*   **“See the GNU General Public License for more details.”** – This directs the user to the section that further explains the clause.

The GPL’s copyleft clause ensures that the freedoms granted by the license are preserved in any derivative works, preventing them from being incorporated into proprietary software.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL), and the GPL is a strong copyleft license. This means it contains several provisions designed to ensure that derivative works also remain free software and are distributed under the same terms. Key elements supporting this determination include:

*   **“This program is free software…”**: Explicitly states the fundamental principle of free software.
*   **“you can redistribute it and/or modify it…”**: Grants the user the freedom to distribute and modify the software.
*   **“under the terms of the GNU General Public License…”**: Clearly links these freedoms to the specific terms of the GPL.
*   **Sections 15-17**: These sections explicitly address warranty disclaimers and limitations of liability, further reinforcing the license&#x27;s goal of preserving user freedoms.
*   **The GPL’s core mechanism**: The GPL’s requirement that derivative works be licensed under the GPL itself is the defining feature of a copyleft license.

The presence of these elements definitively indicates that the license contains a copyleft clause.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a copyleft license, specifically the GNU General Public License (GPL). Here’s why:

*   **“This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License…”** – This explicitly states the copyleft nature of the license.
*   **Requirement for Derivative Works:** The license dictates that if you create a derivative work (a modified version of the program), you must distribute that derivative work under the same GPL terms. This is the core of a copyleft clause – it aims to ensure that the freedoms granted by the original license are preserved in any subsequent versions.
*   **Emphasis on Redistribution:** The license&#x27;s focus on redistribution under the same license reinforces the copyleft intent.

The inclusion of this copyleft clause means that anyone who distributes or modifies the program (or a derivative work) must also make the source code available under the GPL, thereby contributing to the continued availability of the program&#x27;s source code and allowing others to benefit from its freedoms.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL), which *does* contain a strong copyleft clause. Here’s why:

*   **“This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License…”** – This explicitly states the terms under which the software can be distributed and modified.
*   **“...ensuring that the freedoms granted by the license are preserved in derivative works.”** – This is the core of the copyleft provision.  Any derivative work (a program that incorporates or modifies this original program) *must* also be licensed under the GPL. This ensures that the freedoms afforded by the original license are maintained throughout the software&#x27;s lifecycle.

The license’s design is specifically intended to prevent proprietary software from being created based on the original code by compelling derivative works to also be licensed under the GPL.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Majority vote resulting from: True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True">True</abbr></td></tr><tr><td>GPL-3.0-or-later</td><td>Yes</td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

This is the GNU Library General Public License (GPL), and it **does not** contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPLv3 or GPLv4. While it does require that derivative works also be licensed under the GPL, it allows for incorporating the library into proprietary software. The key difference is that the GPL in this case is a “weak copyleft” license, meaning that it only applies to modifications *of the library itself*, not to the entire program that incorporates it.

**Explanation:**

This is the GNU Library General Public License (GPL), and it does *not* contain a copyleft clause. The GPL is a &quot;weak copyleft&quot; license.

**Explanation:**

This is the GNU Library General Public License (GPL), and it does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPLv3 or GPLv4. While it does include a notice about redistributing the library under the same license, it allows you to incorporate the library into proprietary software.

**Explanation:**

The GNU Library General Public License (LGPL) is a *weak* copyleft license. This means it allows linking to the library from proprietary software. While it requires derivative works that *rely* on the library to be licensed under the LGPL, it doesn&#x27;t force *all* derivative works to be licensed under the LGPL. This is a key distinction from stronger copyleft licenses like the GPL, which demand that *all* derivative works are also licensed under the GPL.

**Explanation:**

This is the GNU Library General Public License (GPL), which is a copyleft license. However, it doesn’t enforce copyleft on *all* derived works. Specifically, sections 14 and 15 explicitly state that it does not require derivative works to be licensed under the GPL. It also includes a clause stating that the copyright holder doesn’t impose restrictions on distribution by third parties. The license focuses on ensuring that the library itself remains free software and that recipients of copies are aware of their rights, but it doesn&#x27;t mandate that modifications or additions to the library also be released under the GPL.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the GNU Library General Public License (LGPL), which is a *weak* copyleft license. It does *not* require that derivative works be licensed under the LGPL itself. Instead, it allows you to link LGPL-licensed libraries into proprietary software. The key provision is that if you modify the LGPL-licensed library itself, those modifications must be released under the LGPL. However, if you simply link the library into your own code, your code can remain under a different license (e.g., a commercial license). This makes it a more permissive license than a strong copyleft license like the GPL.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU Library General Public License (LGPL) is a permissive license. While it allows linking to the library, it doesn&#x27;t mandate that derivative works also be licensed under the LGPL. It&#x27;s designed to encourage libraries to be used in both free and proprietary software. The license focuses on allowing redistribution of the library itself, with provisions for changes and derivative works to be under different licenses. The key difference from a strong copyleft license (like the GPL) is that it doesn&#x27;t force modifications to the library itself to also be released under the LGPL.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the GNU Library General Public License (GPL), and it does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPLv3. While it requires that derivative works also be licensed under the GPL, it allows for &quot;compatible&quot; licenses to be used alongside the library. This means you can link the library with software under other licenses (like the BSD license or MIT license) without forcing those derivative works to also be GPL-licensed. The key element here is the requirement that *any* derivative work that *incorporates* the library must also be licensed under the GPL.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the GNU Library General Public License (GPL), and it does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPLv3. While it does require that derivative works be licensed under the GPL, it allows for incorporating the library into proprietary software. The key difference from the GPLv3 is that it doesn&#x27;t mandate that *all* derived works be licensed under the GPL; only those that are distributed as a library or modified and distributed. This makes it a permissive license, allowing for more flexibility in how it&#x27;s used.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the GNU Library General Public License (GPL), and it does *not* contain a copyleft clause. The license explicitly states that &quot;You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&quot; This limitation prevents linking the library with proprietary software, but it doesn&#x27;t require that derivative works also be licensed under the GPL.  A copyleft clause would have required any software that incorporated this library to be released under the GPL.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the GNU Library General Public License (LGPL), and it does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPL. Here’s a breakdown of why:

*   **LGPL allows linking:** The LGPL specifically permits you to link your library with non-free (proprietary) software. This is a key difference from the GPL, which restricts linking to non-free software.
*   **LGPL allows modifications:** You can modify the LGPL-licensed library and distribute those changes, even if the changes are not released under the LGPL itself.
*   **Weak Copyleft:** The LGPL has a &quot;weak copyleft&quot; effect. This means that if *you* modify the LGPL-licensed library and distribute your changes, those changes must be released under the LGPL. However, if someone else links to your modified library in their own program (that isn&#x27;t LGPL-licensed), those changes do not need to be released under the LGPL.

The license’s primary goal is to allow maximum flexibility for developers, which is reflected in its permissive nature regarding linking with proprietary software.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the GNU Library General Public License (LGPL), and it does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPLv3. While it encourages free software practices, it allows you to link your code with the library without requiring your entire program to be licensed under the LGPL. It’s a “weak copyleft” license. Here’s why it doesn’t qualify as a strong copyleft:

*   **Linking Allowed:** The license explicitly permits linking the library with non-free software.
*   **Limited Copyleft:** The license requires that modifications to the library itself be released under the LGPL, but it doesn&#x27;t force you to make your entire program open-source.

Because of these aspects, it&#x27;s a weaker copyleft license compared to the GPL.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU Library General Public License (LGPL) is a permissive license. While it allows you to link to the library in proprietary software, it doesn’t mandate that derivative works also be licensed under the LGPL. It does, however, offer a mechanism for linking to the library in proprietary software, and allows the library itself to be modified and re-distributed under the LGPL. This is achieved through a &quot;weak copyleft&quot; approach – it protects the library itself but doesn&#x27;t force derivative works to adopt the same licensing terms. There is no explicit provision to ensure derivative works remain free software.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU Library General Public License (LGPL) is a *weak* copyleft license. This means it allows you to link libraries developed under LGPL into proprietary software. However, if you modify the LGPL-licensed library itself, those changes must be made available under the LGPL. The license doesn&#x27;t force you to license *all* derivative works – only modifications to the LGPL-licensed library itself. It does not contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPL, which would require *all* derived works to be licensed under the GPL.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the GNU Library General Public License (GPL), and it does *not* contain a copyleft clause. The license grants the recipient the rights to use, copy, distribute, and modify the library, but it does *not* require that derivative works also be licensed under the GPL. It does, however, state that if you distribute a derivative work, you must provide a copy of the license and copyright notice.

**Explanation:**

The GNU Library General Public License (LGPL) is a permissive license, not a copyleft license. While it allows linking to the library from proprietary software, it doesn’t require that derivative works also be licensed under the LGPL. The key characteristic of the LGPL is that it allows you to use the library in both free and proprietary software. The license encourages sharing of source code, but it doesn’t impose restrictions on how the library is incorporated into other software.  A copyleft license, like the GPL, would have a clause requiring any derivative works to also be licensed under the GPL.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU Library General Public License (LGPL) is a *weak copyleft* license. While it does have copyleft provisions, they are less restrictive than those found in stronger copyleft licenses like the GPL. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of why it&#x27;s considered weak copyleft:

*   **Linking Allowed:** The LGPL permits linking to the library from non-free software. This is a key difference from the GPL, which generally prohibits linking to the library from proprietary software.
*   **Modification of Library Allowed:** You can modify the LGPL library itself without being required to release your derivative work under the LGPL.
*   **Re-linking Allowed:** You can re-link the LGPL library into your own compiled binary, even if your binary is not licensed under the LGPL.

Because of these allowances, the LGPL does not impose a strict copyleft requirement. It’s more about ensuring that changes to the library itself are made available. The fact that linking to the library is permitted without requiring the entire derivative work to be licensed under the LGPL is what makes it a weak copyleft license.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the GNU Library General Public License (LGPL), which is a *weak* copyleft license. It allows libraries to be linked into proprietary software. The key distinction is that if you modify the library itself and redistribute the modified library, you *must* release your changes under the LGPL. However, if you simply link the library into your own application (without modifying the library itself), you are not obligated to release your application under the LGPL. This contrasts with stronger copyleft licenses like the GPL, which require *all* derivative works to be released under the same license.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU Library General Public License (LGPL) is a permissive license, meaning it allows you to use, modify, and distribute the library (or derivative works) under different license terms, including proprietary licenses. It does *not* enforce a copyleft clause, requiring derivative works to also be licensed under the LGPL. The license explicitly allows you to link with the library in proprietary software. This is a key distinction from more restrictive copyleft licenses like the GPL.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the GNU Library General Public License (GPL), and it does **not** contain a copyleft clause. While the GPL does have strong provisions for ensuring that derivative works also remain under the GPL, it doesn&#x27;t *require* that all derivative works are licensed under the GPL. The key aspects of the GPL that might *seem* like copyleft are the provisions related to redistribution and modification, but these don&#x27;t mandate that derivative works themselves must be GPL-licensed.

**Explanation:**

The GNU Library General Public License (LGPL) is a permissive license, meaning it allows you to use, modify, and distribute the library (and derivative works) under different licenses, including proprietary licenses. It does *not* require that derivative works also be licensed under the LGPL. While the LGPL does have some provisions to encourage its use in larger projects, it doesn&#x27;t enforce a copyleft requirement. The key phrase indicating this is the clause stating that &quot;You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.&quot; This explicitly allows linking with the library in proprietary code.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU Library General Public License (LGPL) is a *weak copyleft* license. This means it allows you to link LGPL-licensed libraries into proprietary software. However, if you *modify* the LGPL library itself, those modifications must still be distributed under the LGPL. It does *not* require that any software that uses the library also be licensed under the LGPL. It&#x27;s a compromise designed to encourage widespread use of the library while still providing protection for its original developers. Because it does not mandate that derivative works also be licensed under the LGPL, it does not contain a strong copyleft clause.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU Library General Public License (LGPL) is a permissive license. While it allows linking to the library, it doesn’t impose a copyleft requirement on *derived works* that use the library.  This means that if you create a program that links to the LGPL-licensed library, you can distribute your program under any license you choose (including a proprietary license). The LGPL is designed to encourage library usage without forcing every derivative work to also be free software. The key clause to note is the restriction on modifying the library itself (the LGPL restricts *re-linking* the library), not the resulting application that utilizes it.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

This is a GNU Library General Public License (GPL). While the GPL *does* have a copyleft clause (specifically, Section 9), the question asks if the *license itself* contains a copyleft clause. The license document itself, with its terms and conditions, is where the copyleft provisions are explicitly stated. The above answer confirms that the license document does contain a copyleft clause.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the GNU Library General Public License (GPL), and it does *not* contain a copyleft clause. The license allows you to use, modify, and distribute the library, even in proprietary software. However, if you *distribute* a modified version of the library, you *must* provide the original license and copyright notice. It’s a permissive license allowing use in both open-source and closed-source projects, as long as the original license and copyright notice are included.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This license is a permissive license, not a copyleft license. It allows you to use, modify, and distribute the library, even in proprietary software, without requiring those derivative works to also be licensed under the same terms. The explicit disclaimer of warranty and the broad permissions (&quot;You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License...&quot;) clearly demonstrate this permissive nature. There&#x27;s no requirement for derivative works to carry the same license.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This license is a permissive license. It allows you to use, modify, and distribute the library (or derivative works) under different license terms, including proprietary licenses. There is no requirement that derivative works must also be licensed under the GNU Library General Public License. This is evidenced by the explicit statement that &quot;You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&quot;">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the GNU Library General Public License (GPL), which is a strong copyleft license. However, the question specifically asks if it *contains* a copyleft clause. The GPL *does* contain a copyleft clause – it requires that any derivative works based on the library also be licensed under the GPL. Therefore, the answer is yes, it contains a copyleft clause. The initial response was incorrect in stating &#x27;no&#x27; as a comprehensive answer needs to include the fact that the GPL is a copyleft license.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU Library General Public License (LGPL) is a permissive license, not a strong copyleft license like the GPL. While it grants users the freedom to use, study, change, and redistribute the library, it doesn&#x27;t require that derivative works also be licensed under the LGPL. It allows libraries to be linked into proprietary software. The key distinction is that modifications to the library itself can be distributed under different licenses, including proprietary ones. The license does provide safeguards to ensure that users of the library can continue to benefit from its freedoms.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The GNU Library General Public License (LGPL) is a permissive license. While it allows you to link the library with proprietary software, it’s not a strong copyleft license like the GPL. Here’s why it doesn’t have a copyleft clause:

*   **Linking with Proprietary Code:** The LGPL explicitly permits linking the library with proprietary software. This is a key difference from the GPL, where any derivative work must also be licensed under the GPL.
*   **LGPL’s Goal:** The LGPL is designed to encourage the use of free libraries while still allowing developers to incorporate them into commercial products.

Because the LGPL doesn&#x27;t require derivative works to be licensed under the same terms, it lacks a copyleft clause.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="Majority vote resulting from: False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False">False</abbr></td></tr><tr><td>LGPL-2.1-only</td><td>Yes (restricted)</td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and it **does not** contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPL. While it does require that derivative works be distributed under the same license, it allows for linking with proprietary software. This is a key distinction. The LGPL is designed to be more permissive, allowing libraries to be used in both free and commercial software projects. The core requirement is that modifications to the library itself must be released under the LGPL.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and it does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPL. While it encourages free software development, it allows you to link the library with proprietary software. Specifically, the license states: &quot;You may link the library with proprietary software.&quot; This is a key difference from the GPL, which mandates that any derivative works also be licensed under the GPL. The LGPL is designed to be more flexible, allowing developers to use the library in commercial applications without requiring the entire application to be open-sourced.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and it does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPL. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **Weak Copyleft:** The LGPL allows you to link libraries developed under the LGPL into proprietary software. This is a key difference from the GPL, which prohibits this.
*   **No Requirement for Derivative Works to be LGPL:**  You can modify the LGPL library itself and distribute those changes under a different license (including a proprietary license).
*   **Linking is Permitted:** The LGPL specifically permits linking to the library from proprietary software.

Because it lacks a strong copyleft requirement, the LGPL is designed to encourage wider adoption of libraries while still allowing for flexibility in how they are used within larger projects.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and it does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPL. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **Linking Allowed:** The LGPL explicitly permits linking to the library from proprietary software. This is a key difference from the GPL, which restricts linking.
*   **Derivative Works:** While the license states that derivative works *must* be distributed under the same terms, it doesn’t require *all* derivative works to be licensed under the LGPL itself. It only mandates that those portions of the derivative work that utilize the LGPL library are also distributed under the LGPL.
*   **No requirement for the entire derivative work to be LGPL:** This is the crucial point. The LGPL is designed to be more permissive than the GPL, allowing its library to be used in a wider range of software projects.

Therefore, the license doesn’t impose a copyleft requirement on the *entire* derivative work.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The Lesser General Public License (LGPL) is a permissive license. It allows you to use, modify, and distribute the library in both free and proprietary software. While it includes a clause allowing derivative works to be distributed under the LGPL, it does not enforce a copyleft requirement. This means that if you incorporate the LGPL library into a closed-source application, you don’t need to release your entire application under the LGPL.  The key difference between the LGPL and the GPL is that the LGPL is designed to encourage use in commercial software, while the GPL mandates that all derivative works also be GPL-licensed.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and it does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPL. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of why:

*   **Permissive Licensing:** The LGPL is designed to be more permissive than the GPL. It allows you to link your code with the LGPL-licensed library without requiring you to license your entire project under the LGPL.
*   **No Requirement for Derivative Works:** The key provision is that if you modify the LGPL library itself, you *must* release those changes under the LGPL. However, if you link your application to the LGPL library without modifying it, you are not obligated to release your entire application under the LGPL.
*   **&quot;No Requirement for Derivative Works&quot;**: The text explicitly states “You can link your code with the LGPL library without requiring you to license your entire project under the LGPL.”

Because of this, it&#x27;s a &quot;weak copyleft&quot; license, offering some protection for the library&#x27;s source code but not demanding that all derived works adhere to the same licensing terms.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the Lesser General Public License (LGPL). It is explicitly *not* a copyleft license. While it allows linking to the library, it does not require that derivative works also be licensed under the LGPL. It allows for proprietary software to incorporate the library without being obligated to release the entire derived work under the LGPL. The license\u2019s protections focus on the library itself, rather than any software that uses it.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and it does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPL. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of why:

*   **Weak Copyleft:** The LGPL allows you to link libraries built under it with proprietary software. This is a key difference from the GPL, which strictly mandates that any derivative works also be licensed under the GPL.
*   **No Requirement for Derivative Works to be LGPL:** The license states that you can link with the library even if your overall software isn&#x27;t LGPL-licensed.
*   **Focus on Library Usage:** The LGPL primarily aims to protect the library itself, ensuring that its source code remains available for modification and redistribution.

Therefore, the absence of a strong copyleft clause makes this a permissive license.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The Lesser General Public License (LGPL) is a permissive license. It allows you to use, modify, and distribute the library, even in proprietary software. However, if you *link* the LGPL library into your own software, you must provide users with a copy of the LGPL license and a notice that the library is LGPL-licensed. The key here is the &quot;link&quot; – the LGPL doesn’t require that your entire application be licensed under the LGPL if you are simply using the library as a component. It does require specific actions when you combine the LGPL library with other code.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and it does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPL. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of why:

*   **Weak Copyleft:** The LGPL is considered a &quot;weak copyleft&quot; license. It allows you to link LGPL-licensed libraries into proprietary software.
*   **No Requirement for Derivative Works to be LGPL:** The key difference from the GPL is that if you modify the LGPL library itself, you don&#x27;t have to release your entire program under the LGPL. You can keep your modifications proprietary.
*   **LGPL Library Modifications:** You *must* release the source code of *any* modifications you make to the LGPL library itself under the LGPL.
*   **Commercial Use:** The LGPL is designed to encourage commercial use of libraries.

Therefore, because it does not require derivative works to be licensed under the same terms, it does not contain a copyleft clause.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and it does *not* contain a copyleft clause.  LGPL is designed to be more permissive than the GPL. It allows you to link LGPL-licensed libraries into proprietary software.  You can modify the LGPL library itself, but you don&#x27;t have to release your entire application under the LGPL if you use the library. This makes it suitable for use in commercial projects.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and it *does not* contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPL. Here’s why:

*   **Linking Allowed:** The LGPL specifically permits you to link the library with non-free software. This is a key difference from the GPL, which restricts linking with proprietary software.
*   **Derivative Works:** While it does state that derivative works must be distributed under the same license, it doesn’t mandate that *all* derivative works be released under the LGPL. You can create a program that uses the library and distribute the entire program under a different license (e.g., a commercial license).
*   **Limited Warranty and Liability:** The LGPL also includes a standard disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability, which is typical of open-source licenses.

The LGPL is designed to be more flexible, allowing developers to incorporate open-source libraries into both free and commercial software projects.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and it does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPL. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **Linking Allowed:** The LGPL explicitly permits linking to the library from proprietary software. This is a key difference from the GPL, which restricts linking to proprietary software.
*   **Derivative Works:** While the license states that derivative works should be distributed under the same terms, it doesn&#x27;t mandate it. You can create a proprietary application that uses the LGPL library without being required to release the entire application under the LGPL.

Essentially, the LGPL provides a balance between allowing free use and modification of the library while still promoting its use in free software.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="Majority vote resulting from: False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False">False</abbr></td></tr><tr><td>LGPL-2.1-or-later</td><td>Yes (restricted)</td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and it does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPL. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **Linking Allowed:** The LGPL specifically allows you to link your code (which might be proprietary) with the LGPL-licensed library. This is a key difference from the GPL, which restricts linking to proprietary code.
*   **Derivative Works:**  The LGPL allows for derivative works to be licensed under either the LGPL or the GPL. This flexibility is what makes it suitable for use in commercial projects.
*   **No Requirement for Redistribution:** The LGPL doesn’t mandate that derivative works be redistributed under the same terms.

In short, the LGPL is a more permissive license designed to encourage wider adoption of library code without imposing the strict copyleft restrictions of the GPL.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and it does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPL. The LGPL is designed to be more permissive. It allows you to link LGPL libraries into proprietary software.  A key difference is that if you modify the LGPL library itself, you don&#x27;t have to release your entire application under the LGPL.

**Explanation:**

This is the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and it does **not** contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPL. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **Linking Allowed:** The LGPL explicitly allows you to link your programs with the library without requiring you to release your entire program under the LGPL. This is a key difference from the GPL.
*   **No Derivative Work Requirement:** The license primarily focuses on protecting the library itself. It doesn&#x27;t mandate that modifications to the library itself, or derivative works built *around* the library, must also be licensed under the LGPL.
*   **Weak Copyleft:** It does include a clause stating that the library is &quot;free software,&quot; but this is more of a statement of intent than a binding requirement.

**Explanation:**

This is the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and it does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause. While it encourages free software practices, it allows you to link the library with proprietary software. Specifically, sections 8 and 17 explicitly outline this capability. The LGPL aims to balance the interests of free software developers with those of commercial software developers. The key point is that you can incorporate the library into a non-free (proprietary) program without needing to release the entire program under the LGPL.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The Lesser General Public License (LGPL) is a permissive license. It allows you to use, modify, and distribute the library in your own projects, even if those projects are proprietary. However, it does have a key provision: if you *modify* the LGPL-licensed library itself, you must make those modifications available under the LGPL. If you link the LGPL library with proprietary code, the LGPL requires you to allow users to replace the LGPL library with a modified version. This is distinct from copyleft licenses like the GPL, which require *all* derivative works to be licensed under the GPL.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This is the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and it does *not* contain a copyleft clause. The key phrase that indicates this is: &quot;You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&quot; This explicitly restricts how the library can be used, but it doesn\u2019t mandate that any derivative works also be licensed under the LGPL.

**Explanation:**

This is the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and it does *not* contain a copyleft clause. While it allows linking with the library, it explicitly permits you to modify the library and distribute the modified version under a different license. The key phrase that prevents it from being a copyleft license is: “You may link with the Library and relink to create another work, as long as you do not relicense the Library itself.” The LGPL is designed to be more permissive, allowing libraries to be incorporated into proprietary software.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The Lesser General Public License (LGPL) is a permissive license. It allows you to use, modify, and distribute the library in proprietary software. However, if you *modify* the library itself and redistribute those changes, you must provide the source code for the changes under the LGPL. This is a copyleft clause, but it’s a weak one. It only applies to modifications you make to the library’s own source code.

**Explanation:**

This is the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and it **does not** contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPL. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **Linking Allowed:** The LGPL explicitly permits linking to the library from proprietary software. This is a key difference from the GPL, which restricts linking in many circumstances.
*   **Derivative Works:** The license states that if you modify the library itself, you must distribute those changes under the LGPL. However, it doesn&#x27;t force derivative works (software that *uses* the LGPL library) to also be licensed under the LGPL.
*   **Weak Copyleft:** The LGPL has a &quot;weak copyleft&quot; effect, meaning it encourages the sharing of modifications to the library itself, but it doesn&#x27;t mandate that derived works must also be free.

**Explanation:**

The Lesser General Public License (LGPL) does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPL. While it encourages free redistribution and modification, it allows linking the library with proprietary software. The key aspect is that if you modify the LGPL-licensed library itself, you can distribute those changes under the LGPL. However, if you link your proprietary application with the LGPL library, you can distribute your application under a proprietary license.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL), and GPL licenses are fundamentally copyleft licenses. This means that any derivative works created from the original program *must* also be licensed under the GPL. This ensures that the freedoms granted by the license (the right to use, study, share, and modify the software) are preserved in any subsequent versions or adaptations. The sections regarding &quot;discriminatory patent licenses&quot; and the overall emphasis on preserving the original license&#x27;s terms strongly confirm this copyleft nature. The license also explicitly states that it does *not* permit incorporating the program into proprietary applications, further reinforcing the copyleft commitment.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a copyleft license, specifically the GNU General Public License (GPL). Here&#x27;s why:

*   **Copyleft Clause:** The core of the GPL is its &quot;copyleft&quot; clause. It states that any derivative work (i.e., any work based on or derived from the original program) must also be licensed under the GPL. This ensures that the freedoms granted by the license are preserved in any modifications or extensions of the original program. This is a key characteristic of copyleft licenses.
*   **Requirement of Attribution:** The license also requires that the original copyright notice and the GPL license itself be included in any derivative works.
*   **Purpose:** The entire framework of the GPL is designed to ensure that software remains free and open-source, preventing proprietary modifications and promoting collaborative development.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a copyleft license, specifically the GNU General Public License (GPL). The key elements that establish this are:

*   **Requirement for Derivative Works:** The license states that &quot;you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License.&quot; This explicitly mandates that any derivative works (modifications or additions to the original program) must also be licensed under the GPL.
*   **Preservation of Freedoms:** The entire purpose of copyleft licenses like the GPL is to ensure that the freedoms granted to users are maintained in subsequent versions and derivatives of the software.

The presence of these clauses definitively classifies this license as a copyleft license.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a copyleft license, specifically the GNU General Public License (GPL). This is clearly indicated by several key elements:

*   **“This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License…”** This explicitly states the copyleft nature of the license.
*   **Requirement for Derivative Works:** The license mandates that any derivative works must also be licensed under the GPL.
*   **The GPL’s core principle** is to ensure that the freedoms granted by the license are preserved in any derivative works.

The inclusion of these elements demonstrates the license&#x27;s copyleft clause, making it a strong tool for promoting free and open-source software.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license, the GNU General Public License (GPL), is a strong copyleft license. The key elements that establish this are:

*   **“This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License…”** – This explicitly states the core copyleft provision.
*   **“…ensuring that the freedoms granted by the license are preserved in derivative works.”** – This reinforces the intention of the license.
*   **Sections 15-17** – These sections further detail the legal consequences of derivative works not complying with the GPL’s terms, including warranty disclaimers and limitations of liability.

The GPL’s aim is to ensure that any modifications or derivative works also remain free software and are distributed under the same terms, preventing the original freedoms from being lost. The requirements regarding &quot;knowingly relying&quot; and the potential for discriminatory patent licenses further strengthen this copyleft intention.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is the GNU General Public License (GPL), which *does* contain a strong copyleft clause. Specifically, sections 13, 14, and 15 all contribute to this. Here’s a breakdown of why:

*   **Section 13:** Allows linking the covered work with other GPL-licensed works, but automatically extends the GPL terms to the combined work.
*   **Section 14:** This section specifies how version numbers are handled, effectively maintaining the core copyleft principles.
*   **Section 15:** Explicitly states “THERE IS NO WARRANTY,” and clearly outlines the risk assumption, which aligns with the GPL’s intent to preserve the source code and prevent proprietary derivatives.

The entire structure and numerous provisions reinforce the copyleft nature of the GPL.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a copyleft license, specifically the GNU General Public License (GPL). The core of a copyleft clause is the requirement that derivative works (modifications or extensions of the original program) must also be licensed under the GPL. This ensures that the freedoms granted by the license \u2013 the right to use, study, modify, and distribute the software \u2013 are preserved in any derivative works. The entire structure of the license, including sections 15-17, explicitly reinforces this principle.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL), and the GPL is a strong copyleft license. This means:

*   **Derivative Works:** Any derivative work (a program that is based on or modified from the original) *must* also be licensed under the GPL. This ensures that the freedoms granted by the original license are preserved in any subsequent modifications or extensions.
*   **Viral Effect:** The GPL’s copyleft clause is often described as “viral” because it effectively forces any derived work to also be open-source, promoting the continued sharing of software freedoms.

The entire document is structured to emphasize this copyleft nature and highlights the requirements for derivative works. Therefore, it contains a clear copyleft clause.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL), which is a strong copyleft license. The key elements that demonstrate this are:

*   **“This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License…”:** This explicitly states the copyleft requirement – derivative works must also be licensed under the GPL.
*   **“...ensuring that the freedoms granted by the license are preserved in derivative works.”** This reiterates the core purpose of a copyleft license.

The license’s clauses regarding attribution, redistribution, modification, and the requirement to provide the source code to anyone receiving the program further enforce the copyleft nature. The inclusion of both the GPL and the Lesser GPL as alternatives highlights the license’s intention to maintain open-source freedoms.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL). The GPL is a strong copyleft license. This means that if you modify or distribute a work derived from the GPL-licensed program, you *must* release your derivative work under the same GPL license. This ensures that the freedoms granted by the GPL are preserved in any derivative works, effectively spreading the copyleft effect. The document explicitly states this obligation in sections 13, 15, and 17. The inclusion of the GPL’s core tenets around distributing source code and preventing proprietary derivatives are strong indicators of a copyleft clause.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

*   **“This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License…”** – This explicitly states the copyleft nature of the license.
*   **Requirement for Derivative Works:** The GPL mandates that if you modify or create derivative works based on the covered work, you must distribute those derivative works under the same GPL license terms. This ensures that the freedoms granted by the original license are preserved in subsequent versions.

The entire document is structured around enforcing this copyleft requirement, confirming that this is indeed a copyleft license.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license, the GNU General Public License (GPL), *does* contain a strong copyleft clause. Several sections reinforce this:

*   **Section 13:** Explicitly allows linking with works licensed under the GPL, but with conditions that require downstream works based on the combined work also to be GPL-licensed.
*   **Section 17:** This section provides a mechanism to ensure that if the license cannot be applied locally, reviewing courts will apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. This effectively ensures that any derivative work will be licensed under the GPL.
*   The core principles of the license – requiring that derivative works be distributed under the same terms – are central to its copyleft nature.

Because of these provisions, any program derived from a program licensed under the GPL must also be distributed under the GPL, maintaining the freedom granted to users.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL), and GPL licenses are explicitly copyleft licenses. This means that any derivative work created from the covered program *must* also be licensed under the GPL, ensuring that the freedoms associated with the original license are maintained in any modifications or extensions. The license’s detailed provisions, including sections concerning patent licenses and the obligation to make corresponding source code available, all reinforce this copyleft nature.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL), which *does* contain a strong copyleft clause. Here’s why:

*   **Section 13:** This section explicitly allows linking with works under the GPLv3 and mandates that any combined work also be licensed under the GPLv3.
*   **Section 2:** While not a direct copyleft clause, the requirement to convey the work with the GPL license accompanying it ensures that derivative works will also be under the GPL terms.
*   **Overall Intent:** The GPL is designed to protect and promote free software by ensuring that modifications and derivative works remain open and freely distributable, preserving the original freedoms. The whole design of the license encourages distribution under similar terms.

The copyleft clause is a core component of the GPL and is fundamental to its purpose.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a copyleft license, specifically the GNU General Public License (GPL). The GPL’s core purpose is to ensure that derivative works also remain free software, subject to the same licensing terms. The entire document is built around this principle, with sections dedicated to extending the copyleft protection to derived works, and prohibiting incorporation into proprietary programs. The requirement to preserve the freedoms granted by the license in derivative works is a defining characteristic of a copyleft clause.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Majority vote resulting from: True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True">True</abbr></td></tr><tr><td>LGPL-3.0-or-later</td><td>Yes (restricted)</td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL), and the GPL is a strong copyleft license. This means it contains several provisions designed to ensure that derivative works remain free software and retain the same freedoms as the original. Specifically, sections related to patent licenses, discrimination of patent licenses, and the requirement to provide source code for derivative works all contribute to its copyleft nature. The license’s goal is to prevent proprietary modifications from being made without also making the source code of the derived work available under the GPL.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL), and GPL licenses are explicitly copyleft licenses. This means that any derivative work (e.g., a modified version of the program) *must* also be licensed under the GPL, ensuring that the freedoms associated with the original program are retained in all subsequent versions. The inclusion of clauses regarding “discriminatory patent licenses” and the requirement to extend patent licenses to downstream recipients further reinforces this copyleft nature. The explicit discouragement of incorporating the program into proprietary programs further solidifies this key characteristic.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license, the GNU General Public License (GPL), is a strong copyleft license. Several key provisions demonstrate this:

*   **“This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License…”**: This explicitly states the requirement for derivative works to be licensed under the GPL.
*   **“See the GNU General Public License for more details.”**: This directs the user to the full text of the license, which contains further stipulations regarding copyleft.
*   **Restrictions on Proprietary Use**: The license explicitly prohibits incorporating the covered work into proprietary programs.

These elements collectively establish a copyleft clause, ensuring that any derived works also carry the GPL terms, preserving the freedoms granted by the original license.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL), which *does* contain a copyleft clause. Here’s how it manifests:

*   **“This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License…”** – This explicitly states the terms under which you can share and modify the software.
*   **“…or (at your option) any later version.”** – This indicates that any derivative works must also be licensed under the GPL (or a later version).
*   The entire structure of the license—requiring attribution and ensuring that modifications are also available under the same terms—is fundamentally a copyleft mechanism. It’s designed to prevent the software from being incorporated into proprietary software, preserving the freedom for users to redistribute and modify it.

The inclusion of the GPL clearly establishes a copyleft clause, ensuring that any derivative works remain free and open-source.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is the GNU General Public License (GPL), which *does* contain a strong copyleft clause. Here’s why:

*   **Section 13:** Explicitly allows linking with other GPL-licensed works but mandates that if you combine the covered work with a work licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), you must adhere to the AGPL’s requirements regarding interaction through a network.
*   **Section 2:** Requires that any derivative works also be licensed under the GPL.
*   **Overall Philosophy:** The GPL is designed to ensure that software remains free and open-source. It’s not just about the original program; it’s about preserving the freedoms of derivative works as well. This aligns with the copyleft philosophy.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is the GNU General Public License (GPL), which is a strong copyleft license. Here’s why:

*   **Copyleft Clause:** The core of the GPL is its copyleft provision. It states that any derivative works based on the licensed program must also be licensed under the GPL (or a compatible license). This ensures that subsequent modifications and distributions remain free and open-source, preserving the freedoms granted by the original license.
*   **Requirement for Derivative Works:** The license explicitly mandates that any modifications or derivative works must be distributed under the same terms, thus enforcing the copyleft effect.

The intention of the GPL is to prevent proprietary modifications of the software and ensure that the freedoms of the original code are maintained throughout its entire lifecycle.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license, the GNU General Public License (GPL), contains a strong copyleft clause. Specifically, Section 13 allows linking with works licensed under the GPL Lesser General Public License (LGPL) but makes it clear that the core GPL terms *do* apply to the linked work. Section 9 outlines how a patent license is granted to further expand freedom. Sections 13 and 14 detail further extension of the license to derivative works. The overall structure and intent of the license \u2013 requiring derivative works to also be licensed under the GPL \u2013 firmly establishes it as a copyleft license. The inclusion of patent clauses further reinforces the copyleft nature by aiming to prevent patent restrictions from limiting the freedom of the software.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is the GNU General Public License (GPL), which *does* contain a strong copyleft clause. Here’s why:

*   **Section 13:** Explicitly allows linking with other GPL-licensed works, but states that the GPL terms apply to the combined work.
*   **Section 2:**  Requires that derivative works also be licensed under the GPL, effectively ensuring that any modifications or extensions to the original program retain the freedom granted by the license.
*   **Overall Intent:** The GPL is designed to ensure that software remains free and open-source. It’s a very deliberate effort to prevent proprietary modifications from obscuring the original freedoms.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license, the GNU General Public License (GPL), contains a strong copyleft clause. Specifically, sections 7 and 13 address this directly. Here’s a breakdown of why it’s considered a copyleft license:

*   **Section 7:** This section details the requirements for granting a patent license if you are conveying the covered work. Critically, it includes a clause requiring you to &quot;extend the patent license to downstream recipients&quot; if you’re conveying the work. This implies that any derivative work, and consequently the downstream users of that work, must also have the benefit of the patent license.

*   **Section 13:** This explicitly allows linking or combining the covered work with other works licensed under the GPL. However, it adds an important stipulation: the terms of the GPL will continue to apply to the combined work. This ensures that the freedoms granted by the GPL are maintained in the derivative work.

The presence of these clauses demonstrates a clear intention to ensure that derivative works also remain freely distributable under the GPL terms. This is the defining characteristic of a copyleft license.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a version of the GNU General Public License (GPL), and the GPL is explicitly a copyleft license. The key elements that indicate a copyleft clause include:

*   **“This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License…”**: This clearly states the conditions for distributing and modifying the program.
*   **Requirement for derivative works**: The license dictates that any derivative works must also be licensed under the GPL, ensuring that the freedoms granted by the license are maintained.

Therefore, the license contains a strong copyleft clause designed to protect the freedom to use, study, share, and modify the software and its derivatives.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL). The GPL is a strong copyleft license. This means:

*   **Derivative Works:** Any modification or derivative work created from the original program *must* also be licensed under the GPL.
*   **Preservation of Freedom:** The copyleft clause ensures that the freedoms granted by the original license—the freedom to use, study, share, and modify the program—are preserved in any subsequent versions or derivative works.

The entire document is structured to enforce this copyleft obligation.  The explicit statements about derivative works, combined with the detailed terms of the license, clearly indicate its intention to protect and extend the freedoms granted to users of the software.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a copyleft license, specifically the GNU General Public License (GPL). The key elements that establish this are:

*   **Requirement for Derivative Works:** The license states: “you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License.” This explicitly mandates that any derivative works (modifications or extensions of the original program) must also be distributed under the GPL.
*   **Preservation of Freedom:** The entire purpose of a copyleft license is to ensure that the freedoms granted by the original license are maintained in any subsequent versions or derivatives.

The inclusion of the GPL license strongly indicates that you’re dealing with a copyleft clause, ensuring that your work and any derivative works remain open-source and freely distributable.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL), and the GPL is a strong copyleft license. Key elements that demonstrate this include:

*   **Requirement for Derivative Works:** The license explicitly states: &quot;you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License,&quot; and further reinforces this with “you can redistribute *derivative* works under these terms”. This mandates that any modifications or derived works based on the original program must also be distributed under the GPL, ensuring continued availability of the source code and preservation of the copyleft terms.
*   **Protection of Freedom:** The core principle of copyleft is to prevent proprietary encasing of the software, ensuring users retain the freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute the software and its derivatives.

Therefore, this license definitely contains a copyleft clause.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a GNU General Public License (GPL), which *does* contain a strong copyleft clause. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **“This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License…”** – This clearly states the copyleft requirement. Any derivative work (a program that builds upon or modifies the original) *must* also be licensed under the GPL.
*   **“...ensuring that the freedoms granted by the license are preserved in derivative works.”** - This explicitly reinforces the copyleft nature of the license.

The GPL’s copyleft clause is designed to protect the freedoms of the original authors and ensure that software remains open-source. This contrasts with licenses like the BSD or MIT licenses, which are permissive and allow derivative works to be used under different terms.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is the GNU General Public License (GPL), which is a strong copyleft license. Here’s why it contains a copyleft clause:

*   **“This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License…”** – This explicitly states the terms under which the software can be distributed.
*   **“...ensuring that the freedoms granted by the license are preserved in derivative works.”** – This is the core of the copyleft provision. It mandates that any modifications or derivative works based on the GPL-licensed program must also be licensed under the GPL.

**Explanation:**

While the Mozilla Public License (MPL) does contain some copyleft elements, it’s not a strong copyleft license like the GPL. Here’s a breakdown of why it&#x27;s considered a “weak” copyleft license:

*   **Choice of Licenses:** The key aspect of the MPL is that you can incorporate MPL-licensed code into proprietary (non-open source) software. You don’t have to release your entire project under the MPL. This is a major difference from licenses like the GPL, which require any derivative work to be licensed under the GPL.
*   **Modification of MPL Code:** If you modify code that is licensed under the MPL, you *must* release those modifications under the MPL. However, you don’t have to release the entire work.
*   **No Requirement for Source Code:** The MPL doesn&#x27;t mandate that you release your source code.

Because of this choice of licenses provision, it doesn&#x27;t meet the strict criteria of a strong copyleft license. It’s a weaker copyleft license as you can incorporate MPL licensed code in proprietary software.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

While the Mozilla Public License (MPL) has some copyleft elements, it&#x27;s not a strong copyleft license like the GPL. Here’s a breakdown of why it doesn’t meet the criteria for a strong copyleft clause:

*   **Optional Copyleft:** The MPL allows you to incorporate it into proprietary (non-free) software. You don’t have to release your entire derived work under the MPL.
*   **Commercial Use Permitted:** You can use the MPL-licensed code in commercial applications without requiring the entire codebase to be open-sourced.
*   **Choice of Licenses:** The license explicitly allows for the use of the MPL-licensed code under alternative licenses.

Therefore, the MPL is considered a “weak copyleft” license because it primarily aims to protect the MPL code itself, rather than ensuring that all derivative works are also open-sourced.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a copyleft license due to the following provisions:

*   **Requirement of Same License:** The core of a copyleft license is the requirement that derivative works (modifications or extensions of the original code) must also be distributed under the same license (Mozilla Public License Version 1.1).
*   **Preservation of Freedom:** This ensures that the freedoms granted by the MPL are maintained in any downstream uses of the code.

The license explicitly states: “You may not use this file except in compliance with the License.” This fundamentally reinforces the copyleft nature of the license.

The presence of Exhibit A, which explicitly references the Mozilla Public License, further strengthens this determination.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This Mozilla Public License (MPL) version 1.1 contains a strong copyleft clause. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **Section 9 (LIMITATION OF LIABILITY):** This section explicitly limits liability, a common characteristic of copyleft licenses.
*   **Section 13 (Multiple-licensed code):** This section reinforces the copyleft nature by providing an option to use the code under the MPL, but also detailing how modifications should be handled.
*   **The MPL&#x27;s core philosophy:** The MPL requires that any derivative works (modifications or extensions) are also licensed under the MPL. This is the defining feature of a copyleft license, ensuring that the freedoms granted by the original license are preserved in all subsequent versions.

The license explicitly states that modifications must be distributed under the MPL, effectively ensuring that the code&#x27;s freedoms are maintained throughout its lifecycle.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

While the Mozilla Public License (MPL) is a copyleft license, it’s a *weak* copyleft license. This means that modifications to the MPL-licensed code itself do not have to be released under the MPL. However, if you incorporate MPL-licensed code into a larger work, the *entire* new work must be licensed under the MPL.

The key distinction is that you don’t have to release your *entire* modified work under the MPL if you are only modifying the MPL-licensed portion. This makes it a less restrictive copyleft license than, for example, the GNU General Public License (GPL).">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

While the Mozilla Public License (MPL) does have some copyleft elements (requiring derivative works to also be licensed under the MPL), it is not a strong copyleft license like the GPL. It includes a significant exception: you can combine the MPL-licensed code with code licensed under other terms (like the BSD license or MIT license) without having to release your entire derivative work under the MPL. This makes it a &quot;weak copyleft&quot; license. The key point is the ability to mix it with other licenses, which distinguishes it from a strong copyleft license.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

While the Mozilla Public License (MPL) is a copyleft license, it\u2019s a *weak* copyleft license. This means that if you modify the Original Code and distribute the modified code, you don\u2019t have to release *your* modifications under the MPL. You only need to release your modifications under the MPL if you include *unmodified* Original Code in your distribution. The key phrase that defines its weakness is &quot;You may distribute the covered code and derivative works under the MPL if and only if you include the MPL.&quot; This allows you to incorporate the Original Code into a proprietary application without being bound by the MPL terms for the changes you make.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

The Mozilla Public License version 1.1 (MPL) is a copyleft license. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **Share-Alike Provision:** The MPL requires that if you modify or distribute the covered code (or a derivative work), you must distribute the modified code under the same MPL license terms. This ensures that any subsequent modifications or adaptations also remain freely available under the MPL.
*   **Protection of Freedom:** The core purpose of a copyleft license is to preserve the freedoms granted by the original license in derivative works. The MPL achieves this through its share-alike requirement.

The instructions included regarding Exhibit A further reinforce this by specifying the need to maintain the MPL terms for any modifications.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

This license is a copyleft license due to several key provisions:

*   **Requirement of Same License:** The license explicitly states, &quot;you may not use this file except in compliance with the License&quot; and &quot;You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis,&quot; reinforcing the need to distribute derivative works under the same MPL license.
*   **Preservation of Freedom:** The core purpose of a copyleft license is to ensure that the freedoms granted by the original license are maintained in any derivative works. This license achieves that goal through its requirements for compliance with the MPL.

The presence of these elements firmly establishes this license as a copyleft license.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

While the Mozilla Public License (MPL) has elements that promote open source development, it does *not* contain a strong copyleft clause like the GPL. Here’s why:

*   **Optional Choice of Licenses:** The MPL allows you to use portions of the code under the MPL or an alternative license. This flexibility is a key difference from GPL-style licenses.
*   **No Requirement for Derivative Works to be MPL Licensed:** You are not required to release your modifications or derivative works under the MPL. You can choose a different license, even a proprietary one, for your changes.

Therefore, it&#x27;s a permissive license, not a copyleft one.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

While the Mozilla Public License (MPL) is a copyleft license, it&#x27;s a “weak” copyleft license. This means that if you modify the original code and distribute your modified version, you *must* release your changes under the MPL. However, you don&#x27;t have to release the entire derivative work under the MPL. You can combine the MPL-licensed code with code licensed under other terms. This distinguishes it from stronger copyleft licenses like the GPL, which require all derivative works to be licensed under the same terms. The license explicitly allows for combining with other licenses, thus not containing a strong copyleft clause.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

While the Mozilla Public License (MPL) does have some copyleft elements (requiring derivative works to also use the MPL), it’s not a strong copyleft license like the GPL. The key point here is that you can incorporate MPL-licensed code into a proprietary (non-free) application. You just need to include the MPL notice and the MPL text itself. You don&#x27;t have to release your entire program under the MPL. This makes it a &quot;weak copyleft&quot; license.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Explanation:**

The Mozilla Public License version 1.1 (MPL) contains a strong copyleft clause. Here’s why:

*   **Requirement of Attribution:** The MPL mandates that derivative works must include a copy of the MPL license text along with the original license text. This ensures the original license’s terms are always maintained.
*   **Share Alike Clause:** Crucially, the MPL states that any modifications to the covered code must also be licensed under the MPL. This “share alike” clause is the core of the copyleft provision. It ensures that any subsequent work based on the original code remains under the same license, preventing its use in proprietary software.

Therefore, the MPL is designed to protect the freedom of the original code while allowing others to build upon it, as long as they adhere to the copyleft terms.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

While the Mozilla Public License (MPL) includes a copyleft element – requiring derivative works to also be licensed under the MPL – it’s considered a “weak” copyleft license. This means:

*   **You can incorporate MPL-licensed code into proprietary (non-open source) software.** You don&#x27;t have to release your entire program under the MPL.
*   **The copyleft applies only to modifications *you* make to the MPL-licensed code.** If you modify the original MPL-licensed code and distribute those changes, they must be under the MPL. However, if you incorporate MPL-licensed code into your own code that you don&#x27;t modify, the MPL doesn&#x27;t apply to your overall project.

Therefore, the license does not have a strong copyleft clause that would require all derivative works to be licensed under the same terms.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This license is a permissive open-source license, not a copyleft license. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **No Requirement for Derivative Works to Use the Same License:** The key characteristic of a copyleft license is that any derivative work *must* be licensed under the same terms (in this case, the Mozilla Public License). This license does not have this requirement. You can modify the covered code and distribute your changes under any license you choose.
*   **“AS IS” Warranty:** The “AS IS” warranty disclaimer further reinforces the permissive nature of the license. It means the original developers are not taking responsibility for the code, and you are solely responsible for any issues.
*   **Multiple License Options:** The inclusion of the ability to use the code under either the MPL or another license highlights that it doesn&#x27;t force adherence to a single license.

Because it lacks the core elements of a copyleft license (mandatory licensing of derivative works under the same terms), this license is considered a permissive open-source license.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="Majority vote resulting from: False, False, True, True, False, False, False, True, True, False, False, False, True, False, False">False</abbr></td></tr><tr><td>MPL-2.0</td><td>Yes (restricted)</td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Reasoning:**

The Mozilla Public License v2.0 is a copyleft license. Several elements within the license explicitly support this:

*   **Section 2.1(a):** Grants the recipient the right to &quot;modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work&quot;. This immediately suggests a right to create derivative works.
*   **Section 3.1:** Requires that all distribution of Source Code Form must be under the terms of the MPL.
*   **Section 10.2:** Addresses the impact of new versions of the license, reinforcing the ongoing applicability of the copyleft provisions.

The presence of these clauses signifies that any derivative works based on the covered software must also be licensed under the Mozilla Public License v2.0, ensuring the continued availability of the freedoms granted by the original license.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

These elements collectively establish a copyleft framework, requiring derivative works to retain the freedoms and obligations defined by the original Mozilla Public License v2.0.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Reasoning:**

The Mozilla Public License v2.0 does not contain a traditional copyleft clause. While it grants significant rights to users, it allows for the creation and distribution of derivative works under different licenses, including proprietary licenses. The license emphasizes that the covered software can be used in a wider variety of contexts without forcing derivative works to adopt the same licensing terms. The &quot;Incompatible With Secondary Licenses&quot; clause specifically addresses situations where a work is distributed under a license that would restrict the freedoms granted by the MPL.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

*   **Section 10.2:**  Addresses new versions, stating that You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version You originally received *or* under any subsequent version published by the license steward. This reinforces the idea that derivative works must also be licensed under the MPL.

The fact that the license specifically requires that derivative works also be distributed under the same terms—making it a copyleft license—is the key indicator.">True</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

**Reasoning:**

The Mozilla Public License v2.0 contains a strong copyleft clause. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **Section 2.1 (Grants):** This section grants You the right to modify and distribute the Covered Software, but *simultaneously* requires that any modifications (Source Code Form) also be distributed under the terms of the MPL.
*   **Section 3.1 (Distribution of Source Form):** This further reinforces the requirement that all Source Code Form distributions adhere to the MPL&#x27;s terms.
*   **Exhibit B - &quot;Incompatible With Secondary Licenses&quot;:** This explicitly states that the license is incompatible with secondary licenses, highlighting the copyleft nature of the MPL.

**Explanation:**

The Mozilla Public License v2.0 does *not* contain a strict copyleft clause. While it grants broad rights to use, modify, and distribute the Covered Software, it doesn&#x27;t mandate that derivative works also be licensed under the MPL. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of why:

*   **Grant of Rights:** The license explicitly grants the right to create and distribute &quot;Larger Works&quot; that combine the Covered Software with other material.
*   **No Requirement for Derivative Works to be MPL-Licensed:** It doesn&#x27;t state that any derivative works must be licensed under the MPL.
*   **Exhibit B - &quot;Incompatible With Secondary Licenses&quot;:** The presence of Exhibit B, indicating &quot;Incompatible With Secondary Licenses,&quot; further reinforces this point. This clause essentially allows for a different license to be applied to derivative works, provided the original Covered Software remains under the MPL.

Therefore, the license is considered a permissive license, allowing for flexibility in how it&#x27;s used and incorporated into other projects.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Yes.

The reciprocal grant requirement (section 3(A)) simply dictates that if you distribute a file containing code from the software, you must also provide the source code to that file under the same license. This is a standard requirement for open-source licenses, but it doesn’t force derivative works to be licensed under the Ms-RL. It’s a requirement for redistribution, not a copyleft provision.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

The Microsoft Reciprocal License (Ms-RL) is a permissive license. It grants broad rights to use, modify, and distribute the software and its derivatives. However, it *does not* include a copyleft clause. The reciprocal nature of the license—requiring you to provide source code for files containing the software—does not constitute a copyleft provision. Derivative works can be licensed under different terms, as long as the original license’s conditions are met (specifically, providing the source code).">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: red;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This license, the Net Boolean Public License, does *not* contain a copyleft clause. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **Lack of Requirements for Derivative Works:** The license grants significant freedom to modify the package and distribute those modifications in various ways (object code, with or without source, etc.) without requiring that derivative works also be licensed under this same license.
*   **No &quot;Share Alike&quot; Provision:** There is no explicit &quot;share alike&quot; clause that mandates that derivative works must be distributed under the same terms.
*   **Focus on Distribution Rights:** The license primarily focuses on granting rights to copy, modify, and distribute the package itself, without imposing restrictions on how those derivative works might be licensed.

To have a copyleft clause, the license would need to include provisions that dictate that derivative works must be distributed under the same terms as the original.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This Net Boolean Public License does not contain a copyleft clause. It’s a permissive license, meaning it grants users broad rights to use, modify, and distribute the software, including derivative works, without requiring those derivative works to also be licensed under the same terms. The license focuses on attribution and doesn’t impose any obligations on modifications.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This Net Boolean Public License does *not* contain a copyleft clause. A copyleft clause would typically involve requirements for derivative works to be licensed under the same terms. This license grants considerable freedom to modify and distribute the package, including the ability to incorporate it into commercial products, without requiring those derivative works to be licensed under the same terms. The license emphasizes that you can use the code however you see fit, as long as you preserve the original copyright notices and disclaimers.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This Net Boolean Public License does *not* contain a copyleft clause. A copyleft clause would require derivative works to be licensed under the same terms. This license grants significant freedom to modify and redistribute the package, including incorporating it into proprietary software, without requiring those derivative works to be released under the same license. The key phrases indicating this lack of a copyleft clause are the ability to use the package in proprietary software, and the freedom to charge a reasonable copying fee.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This Net Boolean Public License does *not* contain a copyleft clause. Here’s why:

*   **Permissive Distribution:** The license grants significant freedom to distribute, modify, and use the package in various forms (object code, executable, etc.) without requiring derivative works to be licensed under the same terms.
*   **No “Viral” Provisions:** There are no provisions that would automatically apply the license to modified versions or derived works. Paragraphs 3 and 4, while offering options for making modifications freely available, do not mandate that derivative works must be licensed under this specific license.
*   **“AS IS” Warranty:** The explicit “AS IS” warranty further reinforces the lack of obligations placed on the user regarding modifications or distributions.

A copyleft license would typically include language that forces derivative works to be licensed under the same terms as the original, ensuring that the freedoms granted by the original license are retained in subsequent versions. This license lacks such a requirement.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This license, the Net Boolean Public License, does not contain a copyleft clause. It’s a permissive license that grants users significant freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software, even in commercial products, without requiring derivative works to be licensed under the same terms. The license explicitly allows for incorporating the code into proprietary software and charging fees for distribution or support. The key phrase &quot;You may... distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs...&quot; demonstrates this permissive nature.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This license, the Net Boolean Public License, does *not* contain a copyleft clause. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **Flexibility in Derivative Works:** Paragraphs 3 and 4 grant significant flexibility to modify and distribute derivative works without requiring adherence to the same licensing terms. You can use the modified code in proprietary software, sell it, or incorporate it into a larger commercial product without obligation.
*   **No Requirement for Source Code Distribution:** There\u2019s no provision requiring you to release your modified source code under the same license.
*   **\u201cAS IS\u201d Warranty:** The \u201cAS IS\u201d warranty clause further reinforces the lack of any obligation on your part to maintain or distribute the code under a copyleft scheme.

Copyleft licenses, on the other hand, impose conditions on derivative works \u2013 typically requiring them to be released under the same or a compatible license. The Net Boolean Public License lacks this crucial element.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This license, the Net Boolean Public License, does not contain a copyleft clause. It’s a permissive license. Here’s why:

*   **Freedom to Modify and Distribute:** The license grants users considerable freedom to modify, redistribute, and commercialize the package.
*   **No Requirement for Derivative Works to be Licensed Under the Same Terms:** The key element missing is a requirement that any derivative works based on the package also be licensed under the Net Boolean Public License. The license allows you to incorporate this package into proprietary software, without needing to release your changes under the same terms.

The license focuses on providing broad usage rights while requiring only that copyright notices be preserved. This is a defining characteristic of permissive licenses, unlike copyleft licenses which demand that derivative works remain open-source.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This license, the Net Boolean Public License, does *not* contain a copyleft clause. Here’s why:

*   **Flexibility in Derivative Works:** Paragraphs 3 and 4 allow for significant modifications and distribution of derivative works without requiring them to be licensed under the same terms. The options listed (making modifications public domain, restricting distribution to a corporation, or providing standard versions alongside modifications) all permit distributing derivative works under different license terms.
*   **Lack of &quot;Same License&quot; Requirement:** A key characteristic of copyleft licenses is that they mandate that any derivative work must be distributed under the *same* license. This Net Boolean license explicitly avoids this requirement.

The license focuses on providing freedom to use and modify the original package, but it doesn’t impose conditions on how those changes are distributed in derivative works.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This license, the Net Boolean Public License, does not contain a copyleft clause. It’s a permissive license. Here’s why:

*   **Flexibility in Distribution:** It allows you to distribute the package (or modified versions) in object code, executable form, or as part of a larger commercial distribution, without requiring those derivative works to be licensed under the same terms.
*   **No Requirement for Source Availability:** The license doesn’t mandate that you provide the source code for modified versions.
*   **Focus on Attribution:** The primary obligation is to include copyright notices and attribute the original work.

Copyleft licenses, conversely, *require* that derivative works also be licensed under a similar copyleft license. This Net Boolean Public License does not impose such a restriction.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This license, the Net Boolean Public License, does not contain a copyleft clause. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **Flexibility in Derivative Works:** Paragraphs 3 and 4 allow for significant modifications, including distributing derivative works with different license terms (e.g., charging a fee, using them solely within a corporation).
*   **No Requirement for Same License:** There&#x27;s no clause stating that any modifications or derivative works must be licensed under the same terms as the original Package.
*   **&quot;AS IS&quot; Warranty:** The inclusion of the &quot;AS IS&quot; warranty clause further reinforces the lack of any obligation to maintain or distribute derivative works under the same terms.

A copyleft license, like the GPL, would have provisions requiring that any modifications or derived works also be released under the same license. This Net Boolean Public License offers considerably more freedom regarding the licensing of derivative works.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This Net Boolean Public License does *not* contain a copyleft clause. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **Flexibility in Derivative Works:** Paragraphs 3 and 4 allow for significant modifications and distribution of derivative works under different terms (e.g., distributing them commercially, using them within a corporation, or changing their names). There&#x27;s no requirement to release derivative works under the same license.
*   **&quot;One of the following&quot; Options:** The core of the license&#x27;s non-copyleft nature is the multiple options presented for distributing modified versions. These options don&#x27;t force derivative works to remain under the same license.
*   **Lack of &quot;Share Alike&quot; Provision:** A key element of copyleft licenses is a &quot;share alike&quot; clause (often phrased as &quot;distribute under the same license&quot;). This license lacks this crucial component.

The license grants considerable freedom in how derivative works can be used and distributed, making it a permissive license rather than a copyleft one.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This license, the Net Boolean Public License, does not contain a copyleft clause. It’s a permissive license that grants users considerable freedom in how they use, modify, and distribute the software. The license explicitly allows for modifications to be placed in the Public Domain, used within a corporation, or renamed executables, without requiring those derivative works to be licensed under the same terms. The key phrases indicating this permissiveness are the allowances in sections 3 and 4.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This license, the Net Boolean Public License, does not contain a copyleft clause. It is a permissive license that grants users broad rights to use, modify, and distribute the software, even in commercial products. There are conditions (like attribution and providing standard versions), but it doesn&#x27;t require derivative works to be licensed under the same terms. A copyleft license would have provisions like &quot;all derivative works must be licensed under the same terms&quot; which are absent here.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="No.

**Explanation:**

This license, the Net Boolean Public License, does *not* contain a copyleft clause. Here&#x27;s why:

*   **Flexibility in Derivative Works:** Paragraphs 3 and 4 explicitly allow for a wide range of modifications and distributions of derivative works *without* requiring those derivatives to be released under the same license. The options presented (Public Domain, corporate use, renaming, etc.) are all designed to allow for considerable freedom in creating new versions.
*   **Lack of &quot;Same License&quot; Requirement:** The key element missing in a copyleft license is a requirement that derivative works inherit the terms of the original license. This Net Boolean Public License does not impose this restriction.

Therefore, because the license permits significant deviation and modification without requiring the same licensing terms for derived works, it’s classified as a permissive license, not a copyleft license.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="Majority vote resulting from: False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False,

Based on the provided license texts, none of them contain a copyleft clause. Here’s a breakdown of why:

*   **Python Software Foundation License (v2):** This license is a permissive license with standard disclaimers and no requirements for derivative works to be licensed under the same terms.
*   **BEOPEN Python Open Source License Agreement:** Similar to the PSF license, this is a permissive license with standard disclaimers.
*   **CNRI Open Source License Agreement (for Python 1.6b1):** This is also a permissive license.
*   **CWI License Agreement for Python 0.9.0 through 1.2:** This license grants permission for use, copying, and modification but does not impose any restrictions on derivative works.

Here&#x27;s an analysis of each license to confirm this answer:

*   **Python Software Foundation License (v2):** This license is a permissive license. It grants broad rights to use, modify, and distribute Python, but requires retaining the PSF’s copyright notice. It contains no copyleft provisions.
*   **BEOPEN Python Open Source License Agreement (v1):** This is also a permissive license, similar to the PSF license. It grants similar rights and includes no copyleft clauses.
*   **CNRI Open Source License Agreement (for Python 1.6b1):** This is a permissive license.
*   **CWI License Agreement for Python 0.9.0 through 1.2:** This license grants permission for use, copying, and modification, but does not include any copyleft provisions.

The key elements that demonstrate this are:

*   **No requirement for derivative works to be licensed under the ZPL:** The license explicitly grants the right to distribute derivative works under different terms.
*   **Focus on attribution and disclaimer:** The license primarily focuses on maintaining attribution to Zope Corporation and including the disclaimer.
