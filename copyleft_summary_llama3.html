* Section 8(b) allows you to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.

Another example is Section (6), which states: &quot;You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the Modified Version&quot;.

The licenses provided do not contain traditional copyleft clauses.

For example, Python&#x27;s main license (PSF License) requires that any derivative work &quot;prepared by Licensee&quot; retain the same license agreement as Python, which can be seen as a form of copyleft-like provision. However, this provision only applies to derivative works prepared by the original licensee and does not impose any requirements on subsequent derivative works.

The zlib License does not contain a copyleft clause. It only requires that derivative works be freely redistributed and marked as altered, but it does not demand that the same license terms be applied to those derivative works. This is an example of a permissive license, which focuses on allowing users to use and modify the software without restrictions, rather than requiring that modifications be distributed under the same license.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="No.">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="No">False</abbr></td><td style="background-color: green;"><abbr title="No. The zlib License does not contain a copyleft clause.
