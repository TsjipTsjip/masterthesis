Interpretation: The requirement of the Python license to provide a brief summary of the changes may definitely be seen as a further restriction the final license prohibits to impose, since it requires to describe the changes rather than only to mention the fact that changes were made and such brief summary must be included in source code and binary delivery. However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement."

However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement."

Thus, historically, EPL-1.0 is the successor license to CPL-1.0, and it is generally accepted that the right to release new versions of the license, under which software can be relicensed by contributors, is transferred to the Eclipse Foundation (for further information see https://eclipse-foundation.blog/2009/04/16/one-small-step-towards-reducing-license-proliferation/)."

Interpretation: The requirement of the Python license to provide a brief summary of the changes may definitely be seen as a further restriction the final license prohibits to impose, since it requires to describe the changes rather than only to mention the fact that changes were made and such brief summary must be included in source code and binary delivery. However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement."

Interpretation: The requirement of the Python license to provide a brief summary of the changes may definitely be seen as a further restriction the final license prohibits to impose, since it requires to describe the changes rather than only to mention the fact that changes were made and such brief summary must be included in source code and binary delivery. However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement."

However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement."

However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement."

However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement."

Interpretation: The requirement of the Python license to provide a brief summary of the changes may definitely be seen as a further restriction the final license prohibits to impose, since it requires to describe the changes rather than only to mention the fact that changes were made and such brief summary must be included in source code and binary delivery. However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement."

However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement."

However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement."

Interpretation: The requirement of the Python license to provide a brief summary of the changes may definitely be seen as a further restriction the final license prohibits to impose, since it requires to describe the changes rather than only to mention the fact that changes were made and such brief summary must be included in source code and binary delivery. However, another interpretation may argue that the final license requires at least disclosure, though not always inclusion, of the complete corresponding source code which enables a sufficiently well trained engineer to extract the differences, understand the changes and derive a summary which then would be, at least partly, in line with the Python license requirement."
