Open source projects use software licensing as a tool to control how their software, and resulting forms such as compiled binaries, are used. However, people interacting with open source projects often do not have a background in law, and these software license texts are inherently legal in nature. This mismatch becomes relevant when project maintainers attempt to introduce code under a foreign license into their project, as the joined working of said license if often not immediately as easy to understand.

This thesis proposes a method to perform computer-assisted reasoning on these license compatibility analyses. It does this by employing large language models to extract key characteristics of licenses which can be easily understood by project maintainers, thus improving understanding of this system.
